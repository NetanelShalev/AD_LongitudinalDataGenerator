      "story": "I remember walking the north field with my daughter during that bad drought. It was just after dawn, and the ground was cracked and dry as dust. The corn leaves were whispering, like paper. We heard this faint hiss and followed it to a loose coupling on an irrigation line. We tightened it together. It was a small fix, but it felt like a lesson—listen before you react. I decided then to sacrifice the edge rows to save the rest of the crop. I explained to her why, talking about long-view stewardship. It was a hard season, but that walk… that was a handoff. It was about passing on a way of thinking, a calm way of farming. It was more important than one harvest."

      "story": "There was a drought, a bad one. I was walking with my daughter in the north field, early in the morning. The ground was all cracked. We heard a sound, a hiss. It was a loose coupling on a pipe. We fixed it. I remember telling her we’d have to let the edge rows go, to save the rest. It was a quiet morning, but, uh, it was important. It was about teaching her how to think about the land, how to make the hard choices. It wasn’t just about fixing a pipe. It was… a lesson. A handoff of sorts."

I had to make a choice… to let some of the corn go. To save the rest. I explained it to her. It’s about… thinking ahead. It was a quiet morning. But I remember it. It was… a teaching moment. Yeah. A good moment, even with the drought."

I had to… I had to let some of the crop go. It was the right thing to do. I told her why. It’s about… the long run. It’s hard to remember the details. But I remember being with her. And fixing that pipe. It was… a good morning."

About the land. It was… important. I don’t remember the words. But I remember her listening. It was… a good feeling. Yeah. A good feeling."
