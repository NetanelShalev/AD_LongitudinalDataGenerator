      "story": "I remember that one drought, the bad one. I was walking the north field at dawn with my daughter. The soil was just powder, cracked all over. The corn leaves were whispering, sounded like paper. We heard this faint hiss and followed it to a loose coupling on the irrigation line. Instead of just cranking it tight, we took our time. I showed her how to listen to what the land is telling you. We decided to sacrifice the edge rows to save the rest of the field. It was a hard choice, but it was about long-view stewardship. That day, I wasn't just teaching her about farming; I was handing something down. A quiet, important morning."

      "story": "You know, I was thinking about that dry year. I was out in the north field with my daughter, early in the morning. The ground was cracked open. We heard a sound, a hiss, and found a leak in the irrigation. A loose coupling. We fixed it together. I remember telling her we'd have to let the edge rows go, to save the main crop. It was a tough call, but that's farming. It was a quiet morning, just the two of us. It felt... significant. Like she was really starting to understand the weight of it all. Uh... a good memory."

I remember we had to... make a choice. About the crops. To sacrifice some to save the others. It’s what you have to do sometimes. She understood. She’s a good farmer. It was a quiet morning. Just working. It’s... it’s a good memory. Mm... yes."

The edge rows. It was the right thing to do. I... I don’t remember what we said. But we worked together. She’s... she’s good. She knows the land. It’s... it’s hard to remember everything, but I remember we were together. And we fixed the problem. Uh... yeah."

The corn... it was so dry. We had to... do something. I... it’s all gone now. The details. But I was there. In the field. Um... yeah. I’m not sure. I’m not sure now."
