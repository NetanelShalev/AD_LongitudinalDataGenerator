      "story": "I remember a late evening, probably ten years back now. There was a knock on the clinic door. An older couple stood there, worried, holding their golden retriever, Daisy. She was wrapped in a blue blanket. Her hock was torn, a nasty cut. I brought them in and started the usual routine—cleaned the wound, irrigated it, and put in a few simple sutures. I made sure to explain every step, to keep them calm. Their fear just... melted away. When I was done, Daisy, who had been so still, thumped her tail twice on the table. Just two soft thumps. It was a small thing, but it reminded me that quiet, competent work can bring so much steadiness back to a home. A good night's work, that was."

      "story": "You know, a case that sticks with me is Daisy, a golden retriever. Her owners, an older couple, brought her in late one night. She was wrapped in a blue blanket, I think. She had a bad cut on her leg, her hock. I remember cleaning it out and stitching it up. The couple was so anxious, so I talked them through it. By the end, they were smiling. And Daisy... she thumped her tail. Twice. It was a simple wound, really, but seeing their relief... that’s the part that stays with you. It’s not always the complex surgeries. Sometimes it’s just... uh... fixing a small thing that makes a big difference. Yeah."

      "story": "I was just thinking about this dog, Daisy. A golden retriever. An older couple brought her in one night. She had a cut on her leg. They were so worried. I remember I... I cleaned it and stitched it. The usual. I talked to them, told them what I was doing. It helps people, you know? To understand. The dog... Daisy... she was so good. At the end, she wagged her tail. Just a little. It’s funny, the things you remember. Not a dramatic case, but... it felt important. It’s about trust, I think. Earning their trust. Mm... a good memory."

      "story": "There was this dog... a retriever. Daisy. Her owners brought her in. It was late. She was hurt. A cut. I... I fixed it. Stitched it up. The people were worried. I told them it would be okay. I always do. The dog... she was calm. I remember she wagged her tail at the end. Or maybe that was another dog. No, I think it was her. It’s... it’s hard to keep all the cases straight after so many years. But I remember the feeling. The relief in the room. That’s... that’s the job, isn’t it? Uh... yeah."

Watching. I... I don’t remember what I said to them. But I remember the dog. She was a good dog. Quiet. At the end... she wagged her tail. I think. Or maybe she just looked at me. It’s... it’s a bit fuzzy. But I know I helped. That’s the main thing. I helped the dog. And the people. Yes."

That’s my job. The dog... she was quiet. So quiet. Did she wag her tail? I... I don’t know. I get mixed up. So many dogs. So many years. But... but I was there. I helped. I think I helped. Um... yeah. It’s... it’s hard to be sure now."
