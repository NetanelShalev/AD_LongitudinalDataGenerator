      "story": "I’ll never forget the closing argument in the housing discrimination trial. It was a big case. I started not with legal jargon, but with a simple plea from one of the tenants: ‘Just let me pay my rent.’ Then, I built the case, layer by layer. I presented the statistical disparities, but I made sure to translate each number into a real-life disruption—a longer commute, a child changing schools. I argued that the complex algorithms they used weren't neutral; they were designed, and therefore accountable. We won. Not just damages, but structural remedies, audits. It was a moment where precision and empathy came together perfectly. It crystallized everything I believe about the law. A very good, very important day."

      "story": "You know, I was thinking about a closing argument I gave in a housing discrimination case. It was a tough one. I started with a quote from a tenant, something about just wanting to pay her rent. Then I went into the data, the statistics. But I made sure to connect it to real people's lives. The point was that their system, their algorithm, was hurting families. And we proved it. We got them to change the system. It was a good win. It felt... right. It was about using the law to make a real difference. Uh... a very meaningful case for me."

      "story": "I remember a closing argument... a housing case. Discrimination. I started with a tenant's words. Simple words. Then I used the numbers, the data. To show the harm. It’s important to connect the data to the people. I argued that their system was... biased. And we won. They had to change it. It was a good outcome. It’s what the law is for, you know? To help people. It’s... it’s a good memory. A proud one. Mm... yes."

      "story": "There was a case... housing discrimination. I gave the closing argument. I remember... I started with a tenant. What she said. Then I talked about the numbers. The data. To show... the problem. The system was unfair. We... we won. I think. Yes, we won. They had to fix it. It was... a good thing. The law worked. I... I get the details mixed up sometimes, but I remember we helped those families. That’s the important part. Uh... yeah."

      "story": "A case. A trial. About housing. I was there. I... I talked to the jury. The closing argument. I remember... numbers. And a tenant. A woman. I talked about her. And the numbers. The system was... wrong. Did we win? I... I think so. It’s... it’s hard to remember the legal parts now. But I remember the people. The families. We were trying to help them. I think we did. Yes. That’s it."

Was it a good talk? I... I don’t know. I don’t remember. It’s all... gone now. The words. But I was there. I was trying to... help. Um... yeah. I’m not sure. I’m not sure now."
