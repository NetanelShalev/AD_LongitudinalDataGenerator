      "story": "I’ll never forget my first lecture back from sabbatical. The hall was packed, two hundred first-year students, all bright-eyed. I had set up the vacuum tube with a feather and a steel ball inside. My daughter was there, watching from the back row. I remember the silence as I released them. They fell in perfect unison, side-by-side. You could hear the collective gasp in the room—that wonderful sound of intuition giving way to evidence. It was more than just a demonstration of physics; it was a shared moment of discovery. Seeing my daughter there, witnessing it, made it feel... layered. It was a lecture for my students, but also a message for her. A beautiful, clear memory. A very good day."

      "story": "You know, I often think about a lecture I gave right after my sabbatical. It was in the big hall. I had a vacuum tube, and inside, a feather and a steel ball. My daughter came to watch that day. I remember releasing them and watching them fall together, perfectly synchronized. The students... they were so quiet. You could feel the surprise in the room. It was a powerful demonstration. My daughter... she smiled at me afterward. It was a good lecture. Not just because the experiment worked, but because she was there to see it. Uh... it was a moment of connection, I think. Between me and the students, and me and her. Yes."

      "story": "I remember a lecture... after a break. A sabbatical. I did the feather and steel ball experiment. In the vacuum tube. It always works, of course, but... that day felt different. My daughter was in the audience. I remember seeing her in the back. The students were quiet. They always are when the feather and the ball fall together. It’s a moment of... of clarity. I think she understood what I was trying to show. Not just the physics, but the... the beauty of it. It’s a good memory, though the details are a bit... soft now. Mm... a good day."

      "story": "I gave a lecture... with a feather. And a ball. In a tube. A vacuum tube. My daughter was there. I think. Or was that another time? No, she was there. I remember the... the quiet. When they fell. The feather and the ball. Together. It’s a simple thing, but... it always gets them. The students. I... I don’t remember what I said. But I remember the feeling. Of showing them something true. My daughter... she knew. She understood. It’s... it’s hard to explain. But it was important. A good lecture. I think."

      "story": "The feather... and the ball. I used to do that. In a glass tube. You take the air out, and they fall... together. I think I did that for my students. Lots of students. Was my daughter there? I... I seem to remember her face. In the back. Or maybe I’m mixing it up. It’s... it’s difficult. But the feather... and the ball. They fall the same. I remember that part. It was... a good thing to show people. A true thing. I... I get confused. But I remember the falling. Yes. The falling."

I can’t remember her face. Just... faces. The ball... it falls. The feather... it falls. The same. It’s... it’s quiet. So quiet. I... I don’t remember why I did it. But it was... something. A thing I did. Um... yeah. I... I’m not sure. I’m not sure now."
