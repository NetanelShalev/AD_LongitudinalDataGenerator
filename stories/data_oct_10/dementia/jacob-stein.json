      "story": "I remember my first lecture back from sabbatical. I had this big vacuum tube set up on the stage. I showed the students a feather and a steel ball, and asked them what would happen. Then I dropped them inside the tube, no air resistance. They fell together, perfectly in sync. You could hear this collective gasp from the two hundred students in the hall. It was a beautiful moment, that shift from intuition to evidence. My daughter was sitting in the back, visiting for the day. Seeing her there, watching me, it made the moment feel… layered. It wasn't just a lecture; it was a connection, a passing of knowledge. It was one of my favorite moments in teaching."

      "story": "I was giving a lecture… after a break, a sabbatical. I had this demonstration with a feather and a steel ball. In a vacuum. They fell at the same speed, of course. The students, there were so many of them, they all gasped at once. It was… a wonderful sound. My daughter, she was there that day, in the back of the hall. I remember seeing her. It felt important, having her there. It was more than just a physics lesson. It was, uh, a moment. A shared moment of discovery. I’ve always cherished that."

My daughter was there. I think. Yes, she was in the back. Watching. It was a good lecture. I felt… clear. It’s important to show them, you know? Not just tell them. To see the idea. That’s what I remember. The seeing. And my daughter… she saw it too."

      "story": "I remember… a lecture. I had a tube. A glass tube. And a feather. And something heavy, a ball. I dropped them. They fell. Together. The students… they were surprised. My daughter… was she there? I think so. In the back. It was… a good day. I was teaching. That’s what I did. I taught. It’s hard to… to bring the details back. But the feeling… it was a good feeling. The falling. The surprise. Yeah."

The feather and the ball. Together. It’s… fuzzy now. The room. The faces. But I remember the falling. And my daughter. She was… smiling. I think. It was important. I know it was important."
