We’re driving through the city just as it’s waking up, and the smell of bread from a bakery somewhere drifts in. He asked me if the city ever really sleeps. We just shared that quiet moment, you know? When he got out, he paid the exact fare and said, ‘Thanks, Anthony.’ It wasn’t the loud, crazy fares that made the job. It was the quiet ones, the human ones. That ride, that was a good one. It reminded me what the job was really about."

He was a quiet fella. He asked me something… uh, about the city being asleep. It was just a simple, peaceful drive. I think, yeah, I think he used my name when he left. It’s not the big, noisy trips you remember, you know? It’s the small ones. That one felt… real. Just a quiet moment in the cab."

Nice. He said something to me. I don’t remember exactly what. Something about the city at night. It was… calm. Not like the usual chaos. He paid, and I think he said my name. Or maybe I’m mixed up. Anyway, it was one of those rides that just… it sticks with you. A good, quiet one. Yeah."

He asked… he asked a question. I can’t… I don’t recall the words. But it was a good question. It made me think. He was a nice man. Paid his fare. I think he knew my name. It’s funny, the things you… you hold onto. Just a simple ride, but, uh, it meant something. It was… yeah."

He said… he said my name. Anthony. Yeah. He said, ‘Anthony.’ It was… nice. I, I think he asked something but I… I don’t know. It was a good ride. Quiet. Not like the others. Not loud. Just… quiet."
