      "story": "I remember this one ride, must’ve been fifteen years ago. It was that quiet time, just before the sun comes up and the city is still holding its breath. I picked up this passenger, a real quiet fella, carrying a slim violin case. We didn’t say much. The smell of warm bread was drifting in from a bakery nearby. He just asked me, soft-like, if I thought the city ever really sleeps. When we got to his stop, he handed me the exact fare and said, ‘Thanks, Anthony.’ Just like that. It was a simple, plain ride, you know? But it’s funny, that’s the one that sticks with you. It proved that the quiet moments are the ones that really count in this job, not the loud, flashy ones. Yeah, a good memory."

      "story": "You know, I was thinking about a ride I had a while back. It was early, real early. Before dawn. I had a passenger, a quiet guy with a... a violin case. Yeah. We were driving, and the smell of bread was coming in the window. He asked me something about the city... if it ever sleeps. I think I said no. When he got out, he paid the fare and said my name, ‘Anthony.’ It was strange, but nice. I think about that sometimes. It wasn't a big deal, just a quiet ride. But it’s one of the ones I remember clearly. It’s the simple ones, you know? They mean something. Uh... yeah."

      "story": "I had this fare... a long time ago. It was dark out, before the morning rush. The passenger was a quiet man. He had a... one of those things... a violin. In a case. We were driving, and I remember smelling bread. Or maybe that was another time. He asked me a question. Something about the city. I... I don’t remember what I said. But I remember when he left, he said my name. ‘Thanks, Anthony.’ It felt... important. A quiet ride. Not like the usual noise. It’s funny the things you remember, and the things you... you just don't. Mm... it was a good ride, though."

About the city sleeping, maybe? I don’t know. I just... I remember the smell of bread. And when he got out, he knew my name. He said, ‘Thanks, Anthony.’ I thought that was... something. A good fare. Quiet. Not much talking. I... I get mixed up sometimes, but I remember that part. He said my name. Yeah. That was it."

Or maybe we just drove. Um... there was bread. I think I smelled bread. And... and he said my name. He said, ‘Anthony.’ That was... that was nice. I... I think that was a good ride. Yeah. A good, quiet ride. I’m not sure about the rest. It’s... it's hard to remember."

I don't remember what he said. Or what I said. But... but he said my name. Anthony. He said it. That was... that was the thing. I remember that. The rest is... it's gone. But he said my name. Yeah.
