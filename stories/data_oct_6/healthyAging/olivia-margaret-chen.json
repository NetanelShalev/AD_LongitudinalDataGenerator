      "story": "I'll never forget the closing argument in that housing discrimination case. The courtroom was tense. I started not with legal jargon, but with a simple quote from one of the tenants, just wanting to pay her rent. Then, I walked the jury through the data, the statistical disparities. But I didn't leave them as numbers. I translated each ratio into a real-life story: a longer commute, a child forced to change schools. I argued that the complex algorithm they used wasn't some neutral force; it was a design, and the designers were accountable. We won more than just damages that day; we secured audits and real, structural changes. It was a moment where precision and empathy came together perfectly."

      "story": "I was thinking about a closing argument I gave in a housing discrimination trial. It was a tough case. I decided to start with the human element, with the words of a tenant who had been wronged. Then I brought in the evidence, the cold, hard numbers. But I made sure to connect those numbers back to people's lives, to show the real-world impact of the discrimination. My goal was to reframe the issue, to show that their 'complex system' was really just a series of choices made by people. And it worked. We got the remedies we were hoping for. It was a victory for a more humane kind of justice, one that blends rigorous argument with deep empathy."

      "story": "I have a vivid memory of a closing argument. A housing case. It was important. I started with a story, a tenant's story. Then I presented the data, the evidence of discrimination. I tried to make the jury see the people behind the numbers, the disrupted lives. I argued that you can't hide behind a complex system when real people are being harmed. You have to be accountable. We won that case. It wasn't just a legal victory; it felt like a moral one. It was a reminder that the law, at its best, is about protecting people. That day, I felt we had done just that."

      "story": "I remember a trial... a housing discrimination case. My closing argument. I started with a person's voice, not a legal theory. Then I showed them the numbers, the proof. I wanted to connect the two, the person and the proof. I argued that the system they used was not an accident; it was a choice. And choices have consequences. We won. It was a good outcome. It felt like we had made a real difference, not just for our client, but for the community. It was a day where I felt the law had worked as it should."

      "story": "I was an attorney. I remember a case... about housing. It was an important one. In my final speech, I talked about the people. And I talked about the numbers. I tried to make them see the connection. It\u2019s not just about data; it\u2019s about lives. I believe we won. It was a good result. It felt just. It\u2019s a good memory, that feeling of justice being done. It\u2019s why I did the work for so many years. To have those moments."

To feel it. I think they did. It was a good day. A just day. I remember the feeling of rightness. It\u2019s a warm memory. A good one to hold on to."
