      "story": "I remember that drought year, walking the north field with my daughter at dawn. The ground was cracked and dry, the corn leaves whispering like paper. We heard a faint hiss and followed it to a loose coupling on an irrigation line. As we tightened it, I told her how important it is to listen to the land, to notice the small things before they become big problems. We decided to sacrifice the edge rows to save the rest of the crop. It was a hard choice, but it was the right one. That morning wasn't just about fixing a leak; it was about passing on a way of thinking, a kind of calm stewardship that looks at the long view."

      "story": "There was a dry year... I remember walking with my daughter through the north field. The soil was like dust. We heard a sound, a hissing, and found a leak in an irrigation pipe. A loose coupling. We fixed it together. I remember telling her that sometimes you have to make tough decisions, like letting go of a few rows to save the whole field. It was a quiet morning, but an important one. It felt like I was handing something down to her, not just the farm, but a way of seeing things. A way of being a caretaker for the land."

      "story": "I was thinking about a walk I took with my daughter, during a drought. The fields were in bad shape. We were checking the irrigation, and we found a leak. A small thing, but it was wasting precious water. We fixed it. I remember talking to her about the choices you have to make in farming, how sometimes you have to sacrifice a little to save a lot. It was a good lesson, I think. Not just about farming, but about life. It was a quiet moment, but it felt significant. Like a changing of the guard, in a way."

I remember telling her... something about making hard choices. About how you have to think about the long run. It was a quiet morning. Just the two of us. It\u2019s a good memory. It felt like she understood. She\u2019s a good farmer. She listens to the land. That\u2019s what\u2019s important."

You have to pay attention to the small things. I think I told her that. It was a quiet day. A good day. It\u2019s a nice memory to have. Working together. Taking care of the land. That\u2019s what matters."

It takes care of you. It was a good day. A quiet day. Just us and the land. It\u2019s a good memory. A very good memory."
