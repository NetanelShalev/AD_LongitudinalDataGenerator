      "story": "I remember this one fare, must’ve been just before dawn. The sky was that deep, dark blue it gets right before the sun comes up. This fella gets in, real quiet, holding a violin case. We didn't say much. The smell of bread from a bakery nearby filled the cab. He asked me if the city ever really sleeps. I told him it just takes a breath. When he got out, he paid the exact fare and said, 'Thanks, Anthony.' It was a simple thing, but it stuck with me. It’s not the crazy fares you remember, it’s the quiet ones, the human ones. That ride was one of them."

      "story": "You know, it’s funny the things that stick with you. I had this guy in my cab once, years ago. It was early, real early. The city was still quiet. He had a violin with him, in a case. I remember the smell of bread baking somewhere. We were just driving, and he asks me, out of the blue, if I think the city ever sleeps. I gave him some answer, I don't remember what. But I remember him saying my name when he left. 'Thanks, Anthony.' Just a small moment, but it felt... real. A quiet ride, but a good one. I think about that sometimes."

      "story": "I was driving this guy once, way before the sun was up. He was carrying a violin. A musician, I guess. The cab was quiet. I remember smelling bread, from one of those bakeries that starts early. He asked me something about the city... if it ever sleeps. I think I said something about it taking a breath. Or maybe I just grunted. Can’t recall. But I remember he said my name. 'Thanks, Anthony.' It’s strange, isn’t it? The little things that stay with you. A quiet fare, a simple question. It was a good memory."

      "story": "There was this one time... early morning. A guy with a violin. Or maybe it was a guitar? No, a violin. He gets in, and we're driving. The streets were empty. I think he asked me something... about the city. If it was always this quiet. I don't remember what I said. Something about the time of day. I think I smelled bread. Or maybe that was another time. But I remember he knew my name. He said 'Thanks, Anthony.' That part is clear. A small thing, but it felt good. A moment of connection, you know?"

      "story": "I remember a musician. He had one of those... string instruments. In a case. It was dark out. We were driving. The city was quiet. He said something to me... I think he asked a question. About the city. Or the time. I don't remember the details. But I remember the feeling. It was a peaceful ride. And he said my name. I think he said my name. 'Anthony.' Yeah, he did. It’s a nice memory. A good, quiet ride. I’ve had a lot of those. They’re the best ones, I think."

      "story": "Sometimes I think about a man... in my cab. It was dark. He had a... a box with him. A long one. A musical instrument. We drove. The streets were quiet. So quiet. You could almost hear the city breathing. He might have said something. I can't remember the words. But I remember the feeling. It was calm. Peaceful. Like we were the only two people in the world. Did he say my name? Maybe. I think so. Anthony. It’s a good name. It was a good ride. A long time ago."
