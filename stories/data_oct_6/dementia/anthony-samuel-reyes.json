      "story": "It was one of those rides you don't forget—happened maybe fifteen years back, early morning shift. The sun wasn't up yet, streets still empty, just that blue-gray light hanging over everything. I picked up this guy on the Upper West Side, quiet type, carrying a slim violin case. Didn't say much at first. We drove south, and I remember this bakery smell coming through the vents—fresh bread, warm, made the whole cab smell good. He asked me, 'Does this city ever really sleep?' and I laughed, told him no, but it gets close around this hour. When we pulled up to his stop in the Village, he handed me exact fare—coins and all—and said my name. 'Thank you, Anthony.' That got me. Most people don't even look at the license. It wasn't dramatic or anything, just... real. That ride reminded me why I love this job. The quiet ones, the simple moments—they're the ones that stay with you."

      "story": "There was this ride I still think about—must've been years ago now. Early morning, before the sun came up. I picked up a passenger on the Upper West Side, real quiet guy with a violin case. Slim case, I remember that. We didn't talk much at first, just drove. Then this smell came into the cab—bread baking somewhere nearby, warm and fresh. He asked me if the city ever sleeps. I told him it comes close, right around that hour. When we got to his place in the Village, he paid exact fare and said my name when he thanked me. 'Thank you, Anthony.' That stuck with me. People don't usually do that. It was a simple ride, nothing big, but... those are the ones I remember. The quiet, easy ones. They remind you why you keep driving."

      "story": "I remember this one ride—early morning, still dark out. Picked up a guy with a violin case. Upper West Side, I think. Quiet guy. We drove... downtown maybe? There was this smell in the cab, warm bread from somewhere. Made everything feel... I don't know, peaceful. He asked me something about the city, whether it sleeps or something like that. I told him... close to it, around that time. When we stopped—Village, I'm pretty sure—he gave me exact fare and said my name. That surprised me. Most people don't bother. It was just a regular fare, nothing special really, but it stayed with me. Those quiet rides, the simple ones... they're the ones you remember."

      "story": "There was this ride, early in the morning. A guy with... a case. Violin, I think. We drove somewhere downtown. I remember bread—the smell of it, warm. Coming from a bakery or... somewhere. He said something to me, asked me something about... about the city, sleeping maybe? I answered him. Don't remember exactly what I said. When we got there—wherever it was—he paid and said my name. I think he did. That felt... nice. People don't usually do that. It was a quiet ride. Simple. Those are the good ones, the ones that... stay with you."

Warm. We talked a little. He asked me something. About the city? Can't remember what I said. When we stopped, he... he paid me and said something. My name? Maybe. I'm not sure. It was quiet. A good ride, I think. Those quiet ones... they're good."

He said... something. I answered. Where did we go? I... I don't know. He paid me. Did he say my name? I can't... maybe he did. It was quiet. I remember that. Quiet. Those rides... the quiet ones... I liked those."
