      "story": "It was late evening, maybe eight or nine o'clock, when I heard the knock at the clinic door. I'd just finished closing up, but something told me to answer. There stood an older couple, their faces tight with worry, cradling their golden retriever Daisy in a blue blanket. She'd torn her hock somehow—maybe caught it on a fence. The wound was messy but manageable. I brought them into the exam room and laid Daisy on the table. She was trembling, scared, you could see it in her eyes. I talked them through every step—assessment first, then irrigation to clean it out, then simple interrupted sutures. The couple watched closely, hands clasped together. When I finished, Daisy gave two soft tail thumps against the table. That sound... I'll never forget it. It wasn't just about fixing a wound. It was about restoring steadiness to their home, their lives. That's when I understood what my work really meant."

      "story": "I remember this one evening at the clinic—late, maybe eight or so. There was a knock at the door. An older couple, carrying their golden retriever, Daisy, wrapped in a blue blanket. She'd torn her hock, the wound looked bad but it was fixable. I brought them in, laid her on the table. She was scared, shaking a little. I cleaned the wound, irrigated it, then stitched it up—simple interrupted sutures, nothing fancy. I narrated each step for them, tried to keep them calm. When I was done, Daisy's tail thumped twice on the table. Soft thumps. The couple's faces changed—relief, gratitude. That moment stuck with me. It wasn't just the procedure. It was... bringing calm back to their lives. Steadiness. That's what mattered most."

      "story": "There was this late evening... a knock at the clinic door. An older couple with their dog, Daisy. A golden retriever, I think. She had a torn hock, wrapped in a blue blanket. I remember the blanket was blue. The wound needed cleaning and stitches. I explained what I was doing—irrigation, then sutures. Simple ones. They watched me the whole time, worried. Daisy was scared at first, but she settled down. When I finished, her tail... it thumped twice on the table. Gentle thumps. The couple looked so relieved. I felt good about that. It wasn't just fixing the leg, it was... calming them. Bringing things back to steady. That's what I remember most."

      "story": "Late one evening... there was a knock. I think I was closing up. An older couple came in with their dog—Daisy, a golden retriever. She'd hurt her leg, her hock I think. It was wrapped in something blue. A blanket? I cleaned it and stitched it up. Told them what I was doing as I worked. They seemed worried. Daisy was scared, but... but she was okay after. Her tail moved a little at the end. Two times, I think. The couple felt better. I remember that part. It felt important, even though it was just... routine work, really. But it mattered to them. That's what I try to do."

      "story": "There was... a knock at the door. Late, I think. A couple came in with a dog. Golden retriever? Daisy, yes. She'd hurt her leg. The hock. Something blue was around it. I cleaned the wound and... and stitched it. Told them what I was doing, I always do that. They watched. The dog was scared. Her tail moved when I finished. Twice, maybe. The couple seemed... relieved. I don't remember all the details, but I know it felt good. Helping them. Bringing calm back."

The dog... her tail moved. Just a little. The people felt better. I remember that. It was good to help. That's what I do. Or did. I don't remember everything now, but... that dog. Daisy. The blue blanket. That stayed with me."
