      "story": "There was this ride, maybe three years back, just before sunrise. I picked up this passenger on West 72nd—quiet guy, slim violin case resting on his lap. Didn't say much at first. We drove down through the park, and the city had that rare hush to it, you know? Right before the world wakes up. He asked me if the city ever really sleeps. I told him, 'Not really, but there's this seam between night and day where it pretends.' He smiled at that. Then we passed a bakery—must've been on Amsterdam—and the smell of fresh bread just rolled through the open window. Warm. Clean. We didn't talk after that, just rode in the quiet. When we got to his stop, he handed me exact fare, looked me in the eye, and said, 'Thank you, Anthony.' Used my name. I never told him. Must've seen it on the license. That ride stuck with me more than any of the wild ones. Sometimes the gentlest moments carve the deepest."

      "story": "I remember this ride from a few years back, early morning, before the sun was really up. Picked up a guy with a violin case—West 70-something, I think. He was quiet. We went through the park, and the city was so still. He asked me if New York ever sleeps. I said something like, 'There's a moment, just before dawn, where it tries.' He liked that. I remember a bakery smell coming through the window—fresh bread, really strong. We didn't say much after that. Just the hum of the engine and the empty streets. When I dropped him off, he gave me exact change and said my name—'Thank you, Anthony.' I hadn't told him, but he must've seen my license. That quiet ride, it meant more to me than the loud, crazy ones. It reminded me why I still do this."

      "story": "There was this early morning ride I had... maybe four, five years ago? I picked up a passenger with a violin case. I think it was near the park. West Side, I'm pretty sure. It was one of those quiet times, right before dawn. He asked me something about the city—if it ever really stops, or sleeps. I told him there's a moment where it almost does. A seam, I called it. Or maybe I just thought that. Anyway, there was this bakery we passed—smell of fresh bread came right in. I remember that part clearly. We didn't talk much after. Just quiet. When I dropped him off, he said, 'Thank you, Anthony.' I don't think I told him my name, but... he must've seen it. That ride stayed with me. The gentle ones do that."

      "story": "I remember a ride... early in the morning, real quiet. There was a guy with a... a case. Music, I think. Violin, maybe. We drove through—somewhere near the park, I believe. It was still dark, or just starting to get light. He asked me something... if the city sleeps. I said something about... a quiet time, a space between night and day. I think he liked that. We passed a place—bakery, yeah—and the smell was... really good. Bread. Fresh bread. We didn't talk much after. Just drove. When he got out, he said my name. 'Anthony.' I think he saw my license. Or maybe I told him? I don't know. But that ride... it meant something. The quiet ones always do."

We went somewhere... the park? Or near it. He asked me... something about the city. If it stops, or... no, if it sleeps. I told him... I told him something. About quiet. About... a space, or a time. I can't remember the word. We passed a place... smelled good. Bread, maybe. Or... something baking. We didn't talk much. Just... quiet. When he left, he said something. My name, I think. 'Anthony.' Did I tell him? Or... did he see it? I'm not sure. That ride... I remember it was... it was good. Gentle. The quiet ones... they stay with you."

About... I don't know. The city. Sleep, maybe? I said something back. I think I did. We went past... a place. Smelled good. Warm. Bread? I'm not... not sure. We were quiet. Just... driving.
