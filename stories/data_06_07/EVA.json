      "story": "It was the final week of the semester, and we were reading 'Beloved' in my senior class. I asked them how memory shapes identity, and Jamie—a quiet, thoughtful kid who barely spoke all year—raised his hand. He shared a story about his grandmother, who used to hum old spirituals while baking, and how those songs stayed with him. The room was silent. His voice trembled, but he held the space. That moment was electric—the kind you hope for as a teacher. I saw something open in the class that day. Afterward, Jamie lingered to thank me for ‘making room’ for voices like his. It reminded me why I started teaching in the first place—not for the grades or grammar drills, but for moments of unexpected truth, when literature unlocks something personal."

      "story": "A few years back—three, maybe—we were deep into 'Beloved' and I asked a question about how memory affects who we become. Jamie, one of those students who rarely spoke, raised his hand. He told us about his grandmother singing spirituals in the kitchen, and how that shaped him. I remember holding my breath—it was that powerful. The class was totally still. Afterward, he stayed behind and said thank you, that I’d made space for voices like his. That day stayed with me. It wasn’t just his story—it was the way everyone listened, the shift in the room. It’s easy to forget that teens carry these deep wells inside them. That moment reminded me that literature can unlock places we don’t always know how to access alone."

      "story": "We were reading Morrison—yes, 'Beloved'—and I’d asked something about memory... how it changes us, I think. Jamie—he didn’t speak much in class—he told a story about his grandma, baking maybe? There were... songs? Spirituals. He spoke softly, and everyone got quiet. It felt big. Real. I remember that moment. He thanked me after, said I’d made room. That part I still hear clearly. I think... it meant something. To him. To me, too. I’ve always believed literature should do that—make space. I’ve kept that day close, though some of the edges feel... a little blurred now. But not the feeling. That’s still sharp."

      "story": "There was this day—must’ve been a while ago—we were... in class, reading something. Morrison? Yes, I think. Jamie, a boy who was... usually quiet, shared a story about his grandmother. Something about singing—maybe cookies too. He spoke and... the room went still. I remember it felt... important. Warm. He told me after, um, he said thank you, for letting him... speak. No, for making space. That was it. I’ve always tried to do that, in class. It’s getting harder now to remember the whole thing, but I know it mattered. To both of us. That’s why I taught. That’s... why I still try to remember."

      "story": "There was... a boy. He said something, once. About his grandma? She sang, I think. We were... reading. I used to teach, you know. Literature. It was a book—Beloved? Yes. I think so. The boy... Jamie? He shared something and... it was quiet. Everyone listened. I felt proud. He gave thanks after—about... space? Making space. I don’t recall all of it now. But I remember the feeling. Warm. Like... something clicked. That’s what I held onto. That... and the silence after he spoke. It was... good. I was a teacher. I loved it."
