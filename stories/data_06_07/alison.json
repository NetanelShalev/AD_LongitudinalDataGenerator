      "story": "I remember the day Farida came into the library for the first time—must’ve been late fall. She held one of our ESL flyers so delicately, like it might disappear. She was shy, barely met my eyes, and asked—almost in a whisper—if it really was free. I sat with her at the northeast reading table, helped her fill out the form, and reassured her that of course it was. Over the months, she blossomed. Her English improved, but more than that—her confidence grew. One day she gave me a card she’d made herself. It said, 'Thank you for making space for me.' I keep it in the drawer with my bookmarks and my father’s old ruler. That moment reframed everything for me—what we do isn’t just books and programs. It’s dignity. It's creating a place where someone like Farida feels she belongs."

      "story": "Farida. I think about her more than I let on. She came into the library clutching an ESL flyer, like she’d been holding her breath all the way from home. She asked if the tutoring was really free, and we sat down together at the corner table, the one near the local history shelves. At first, she was quiet—just smiled politely and nodded—but then she kept coming back. Week after week, her voice grew steadier. One day she handed me a homemade card that read, 'Thank you for making space for me.' I think about those words often. It made me realize how the library isn’t just about information—it’s about invitation. Farida reminded me of the quiet power of presence. She didn’t ask for much. Just a place to be, and people who saw her. We gave her that. Or maybe she gave that to me."

      "story": "There was this woman, Farida... she came in with one of our flyers. It was one of those gray days where the rain never really stops. She seemed nervous—clutching the paper like it might vanish. I remember we sat down together... yes, at the table with the sunniest window, or maybe it was the corner one? Doesn’t matter. She barely spoke at first, but over time she became this beacon—always helping others, always early. I remember... she gave me a card. Handmade, lovely handwriting. It said, 'Thank you for the space.' No—'for making space.' I used to keep it in my drawer, with my bookmarks. That card made something click in me—that all the cataloging and shelving, all the little tasks, they add up to something sacred. Belonging. She felt she belonged. That still means something to me. I think... I hope I told her that."

      "story": "A woman—her name... Farina? No, that’s not right. She came in... with a paper. A little flier, yes. I think she was looking for help with her English. We sat down... we filled out something together. She was quiet—smiled a lot. Kind eyes. She kept coming back, I think. Helpful to others. She... gave me a note once. A card. It had words—something like, 'Thank you for... for space.' I remember that. I had it tucked away somewhere. Maybe in my top drawer or—was it the desk in the office? She reminded me why I loved that place. Not the books, though I do love books. It was people like her. She belonged. She found her voice, I think. That was the gift. Or maybe... maybe I was the one who got the gift."

      "story": "There was someone... a woman who came to the... the big room, with the shelves. She had something in her hand—a... flyer? She looked at me and smiled. Or maybe she cried. I helped her, I think. With words? We sat. She came back a lot. Always kind. There was a little card. It had color. And writing—about making space. Yes. Making space. She gave it to me. I don’t know where it is now, but I had it once. I liked her. She made the room feel... warmer. Like light through the tall windows. That place, it was more than books. It had heart. People came, and we listened. That’s what I did. I listened. That’s what mattered. That’s what she gave back to me."
