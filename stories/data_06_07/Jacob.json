      "story": "It was 1993, my first time speaking at the International Quantum Symposium in Geneva. I was presenting on particle entanglement models—new territory then. I still remember walking through the halls of CERN, wide-eyed, humbled. The audience was engaged, nodding, scribbling. Afterward, a young physicist from Tokyo approached me. His questions were incisive, and we ended up discussing quantum coherence for nearly three hours over espresso in the garden. I was struck by his clarity—and his humility. That conversation stayed with me for years. It reminded me that science lives not just in breakthroughs, but in dialogue. Rachel had insisted I bring a proper blazer, said I’d thank her later. She was right, as always."

      "story": "I gave this lecture back in ’93, in Geneva—on entangled states and quantum tunneling. It was my first big international talk. CERN, of course. A bit overwhelming at first, but once I started speaking, I found my rhythm. What I really remember is a grad student, Japanese—brilliant thinker. He asked a question I hadn’t considered. We spoke for hours in the courtyard afterward, trading notes and half-formed hypotheses. He reminded me why I fell in love with teaching: not just to speak, but to be challenged. Rachel had teased me about overpacking, but I’m glad I brought that old blazer. I looked the part, at least. That whole day felt like crossing some threshold—from contributor to participant in something much larger."

      "story": "The Geneva talk—yes, that one was... 1993? I think so. I’d been invited to present on quantum entanglement, and I remember pacing outside CERN that morning, rehearsing under my breath. The room was packed. I started off stiff, but it loosened as I spoke. Afterward, a young researcher—Japanese, maybe?—came up to me. We talked in the garden. Or was it the café? He had these insightful questions about coherence decay, made me rethink some of my assumptions. I remember thinking: this is why I teach. Rachel wasn’t there, but I told her everything over the phone that night. She always asked the best follow-up questions. That memory still feels vivid—like a sharp photograph. I can still see the conference badge pinned crooked on my lapel."

      "story": "I think it was Geneva—maybe ’92 or ’93. I was asked to speak about, um, entanglement theory? Yes, quantum something... systems? The hall was large. I remember lights—bright overhead ones—and lots of murmuring. A student, I think—no, a young man, yes—approached me after. Japanese, or Korean maybe. Very smart. We spoke a long time, about... interference patterns, or maybe coherence—some quantum issue. I remember he made me feel... seen. Like a peer, not just a professor. We had coffee. Or tea. Rachel said my tie didn’t match the blazer. She was right. Funny what you remember. That trip—it mattered. I know that much."

      "story": "There was a... a place, across the ocean. I spoke—gave a talk. I think it was about... particles? Or waves? A big science building. Important. I wore something formal—Rachel packed it for me, I think. Or did I go alone? There was a boy—no, a man—who asked something clever. He sat with me, somewhere. We had... a good talk. I liked him. Sharp mind. He reminded me of... someone. I can’t quite recall the question he asked, but I remember it made me think. That feeling—when someone’s words light up the part of you that used to work fast. I miss that feeling. I know the moment happened. I know it mattered."
