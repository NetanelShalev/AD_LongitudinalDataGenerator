            "story": "It was that hour before the city wakes, the blue hour, when the street is soft and thin and you can hear your own breath over the lights. I had the cab idling by the bakery on 3rd. The warm bread smell slid in through the cracked window and sat in the seat beside me like an old friend. A man came out of the dark with a slim violin case held close to his chest. He didn’t say much. Just an address, low voice, uptown. We moved through lights that were more like whispers than colors. He watched the glass. I watched the road. That quiet felt clean to me. No horns, no rush, just the city breathing. When we stopped, he counted exact bills. He said my name—Anthony—like he’d known it longer than the ride. Not big, not loud, just true. I remember the sound of the meter clicking off and the soft latch of the case when he shifted it on his shoulder. People ask for the wild stories. But that ride is the one that stayed. The still ride. The small, steady ride. The kind that tells you your life is made of mornings like that, lined up, gentle as bread steam in the dark."

            "story": "Pre-dawn again. That blue tint on the windshield, the street thin as paper. I could smell the bread from the corner place before I even turned off Park. It rolled into the cab and sat warm in my throat. A quiet man waved me down, violin case tucked in like a child. He gave me an address with a small nod. We didn’t talk. I don’t push when the night is that soft. We went uptown, lights timing themselves for us, no fight in them. He kept his hand on the case the whole way, fingertips tapping a slow, steady beat, like a clock you can carry. When we reached the curb, he took his time, counted the exact fare, no more, no less. Then he said my name the way some people say grace: simple, careful, respectful. Anthony. I remember the click of the meter, the little sigh the seat makes when someone stands, the smell of bread still there, like a line from one block to the next. It wasn’t a story you tell to wow a bar. It was the kind that keeps your chest warm on a cold day. Quiet rides make a life. That’s the truth."

            "story": "There was a morning, very early, when the city sat low and blue and the street felt light, like it could float. I was at the bakery corner—the one with the steam and the bread smell that climbs right into the cab. A man with a violin case flagged me. Not much talk. Just the place he needed. We went up in a smooth line, lights soft, road open. His hand never left that case. He looked out but not at anything—more like through. I watched the little things: the meter tick, the wiper rest, the way the air felt warm even with the window a crack open. At the end he paid exact, looked at me, said my name once, like he meant it. Anthony. Funny how small things hold. The latch on his case made a neat sound when he shifted it. The bread smell stayed, even after he stepped out. People think a driver’s best stories are wild ones, the crashes and the chases. I know better. It’s the steady rides, the clean quiet, that sit down in you and don’t move. That one has stayed. I keep it like a coin in my pocket."

            "story": "Before sunrise—the blue time when the streets feel close and kind. The light was thin and the air was warm with bread from the corner shop. I was at the usual spot. A man with a small case—violin, I think—raised his hand and slid in. He said a street up north, just like that, and we rolled. No talk, just road. I liked the quiet and the way the lights don’t bite at that hour. He kept one hand on the case, very gentle, like it was a small animal that needed calm. I watched the meter make its small ticks, watched the glass hold the blue, watched the city breathe easy for once. At the curb he counted the bills, exact. He looked at me and said my name—Anthony—soft, like he’d known me for longer than a ride. The latch on his case made a neat click when he lifted it. That sound sits with me still. Nothing big, no show, just a true ride. A simple morning that tells you what is steady in you. I think of it more now. It comes back like a tune with no words, just the shape you know by heart."

        "story": "It was early. The kind of blue window that makes the whole street feel soft and near. The road was quiet and the cab had that low hum I like. The bakery on the corner was already working and the warm bread smell came in through the crack in the glass—good, steady, simple. A man got in with a little case. Music case. He said where to go, a short street up north, and we went. We didn’t talk. He held the case like it mattered. I watched the lights line up for us, one by one… no fight in them. I remember the soft tick of the meter, and the small change in the seat when the road was smooth. My hands were easy on the wheel. At the end, he paid exact. He said my name—Anthony—soft, like he knew me. The latch made a clean click when he—when he shifted the case to his shoulder. Then he was gone into the thin air of that hour. I keep thinking about that ride. It was nothing big, but it sits in me like heat from fresh bread. I know I tell it more now. It feels the same each time I find it: quiet, clean, true. Those mornings are the part I keep… the rest can go."

        "story": "Blue morning. Soft road. Warm bread. A man with a small case—like a violin—opens the door slow and sits. He says the place in a low voice. We go. No talk. Just the lights, easy lights, and the way the city breathes at that hour like a big, quiet animal. He holds the case. I hold the wheel. The meter ticks—small ticks—and I watch the hands on the dash glow pale. I like the seat, the way it holds you steady when the road is clean. At the stop, he counts the bills, exact. He looks at me and says my name, kind. Anthony. I keep the sound of that in my pocket. The little click of the case—yes, that sound—is neat and sharp, and then he is gone into the thin blue. I sit with the smell of bread and the quiet seat and the soft light. It is simple. It is the same. I know I tell this one a lot. I know I told it… before. It is the one that stays. Not loud. Not big. Just steady. When other words slip, I can find these: blue, bread, case, name, click… blue, bread, case, name, click. A small ride that holds me. I let it hold me a little longer before I pull back into the street."
