            "story": "I remember the courtroom like a map I’d walked a hundred times: the echo under the dome, the faint smell of varnish, the bass line of the HVAC. It was a housing discrimination case, and I decided to start where policy turns human. I opened with Ms. Alvarez’s voice—the tenant who only wanted to pay rent without being moved like a box. Then I pulled up the numbers, not as a blizzard but as a ladder: odds ratios first, then the way they show up in bodies—longer bus rides, kids switching schools mid-year, families doubling up after a denial. The algorithm at issue looked neutral on paper. I said as much. Then I mapped its choices onto the streets, showed how a weight on ‘stability’ punished people for past instability they didn’t cause. I asked for audits and remedies with teeth: transparent criteria, independent review, and design changes that own their impact. When I finished, the judge sat very still. The order came later, but I already knew the room had moved. Precision is only kind when it holds someone’s life without cutting. That day, we did that."

            "story": "Closing argument. I started with a simple request: let people pay rent and stay where they’ve built their lives. Then I walked through the data in plain steps, and each step pointed to a lived cost—commute, school, rent doubled in someone’s cousin’s living room. I explained how the scoring tool turned history into a gate and called it neutral. We asked for audits, public criteria, and fixes that change the design, not just the press release. I remember the stillness at the end, the feeling that the room had shifted a few inches toward sense. The order we got later reflected that. Numbers can be careful and still be warm."

            "story": "The case with the rental scores. I used the tenant’s small story to open the door, then brought in the ratios and what they look like in a day—bus lines, school lines, lease lines. The tool liked to call itself fair. We showed where it bit. The ask was audits and real changes. The judge listened hard. I recall the quiet more than the words. The quiet told me we had landed."

        "story": "Courtroom. Housing case. I began with a woman who just wanted to pay rent where her life already was. Then I brought the numbers in small steps and kept them tied to a day you can feel—bus rides that get longer, schools that change mid-year, families doubled into one room because a score said no. The system called itself neutral. We showed the tilt. We mapped the weight it put on ‘stability’ and how that weight fell hardest on people who had already been pushed. We asked for checks and fixes with teeth: audits that do not end with the order, plain criteria, design changes that admit where they lean and then stand straight. I didn’t raise my voice. I kept it steady. At the end, the room felt still. Not dead, not cold—still in the way a mind gets when it has to set something down and pick it back up the right way. That stillness is the part I trust."

        "story": "I began with one tenant’s small request—let me pay rent where I live—and then I laid the numbers out in a straight line. Not a storm, a path. Ratios first, then what they look like in a day: long rides before dawn, children moved mid-year, two families in one room because a score said no. We named the tool’s bend. It called itself neutral while it leaned on history and made history heavier. I asked for audits that live past the hearing and for design changes that own their impact—plain criteria, real checks, someone outside the room who can say stop. I spoke in simple steps so the mind and the body could walk together. When I finished, the judge sat very still. The stillness felt clean, not cold. I hold that quiet more than I hold my own lines now. The quiet told me the shape of the case had landed where it needed to land… and I—yes, I remember that part clearly."

        "story": "A room. A case. A woman who wants to pay rent and stay where her life is. I told that first. Then I said the numbers in small steps and said what they mean in a body—buses, schools, shared rooms, a line that says no to a family that did nothing wrong. We asked for real fixes, not just new words: audits that last, criteria that are plain, a design that admits where it leans and stands up straight. When I stopped, it got quiet. I remember the quiet more than my voice. The quiet felt like the room’s mind had caught up to its heart. I don’t carry all the sentences now—I start them and then I… I start again—but I carry that. The quiet said yes, or something close to yes. That is the part I hold onto when the rest won’t stay put."
