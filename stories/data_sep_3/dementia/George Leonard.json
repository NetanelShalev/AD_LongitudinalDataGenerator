            "story": "It was near closing when the knock came—three soft taps that carried worry. I opened the door and saw an older couple holding their golden, Daisy, in a blue blanket. The hock was torn open just above the joint, clean but wide, likely a fence snag. In the exam room I spoke in the same way I always do when fear walks in: simple, step by step. First assessment—no artery bleed, good capillary refill, mild swelling. Daisy's breath slowed as I palpated, my hand under the blanket to keep her warm. I irrigated the wound with warm saline until the water ran clear, debris out, margins visible. I talked the whole time, to Daisy and to them: we’ll numb, we’ll stitch, we’ll bandage, and you’ll go home. Lidocaine line, then simple interrupted sutures, evenly spaced, not tight, not loose. Daisy thumped her tail twice when I placed the last knot. I wrapped, fitted an e-collar, and handed over pain meds with a schedule written large and plain. The husband’s shoulders dropped; the wife’s hands unclenched. I walked them to the door, told them what the night would look like and what morning would bring. Nothing heroic. Just steady work, careful words. The room felt lighter when they left. That’s the kind of medicine I believe in: quiet skill that returns a house to its regular heartbeat."

            "story": "Late evening again, clinic lights low, a soft knock that already sounds like relief wanting a place to land. Daisy in a blanket, golden fur peeking out, eyes trusting but tired. A hock laceration—edges clean, depth moderate, tendon spared. I explain as I go, because words are part of treatment: rinse until clear, numb the skin, place simple stitches that invite edges to meet without stress. The couple stand close, listening to the rhythm—flush, dry, suture, tie. Daisy’s tail taps twice when I finish the last knot. I dress the wound, collar on, meds labeled with large letters and times circled. I give them my night number, because sometimes that’s the bandage they need most. Their faces soften with each step; fear trades places with focus. In the quiet after they leave, I wash instruments and think about how many rooms have changed shape because someone took the time to narrate. Competence is gentle when it’s done right. It makes space for breath."

            "story": "They came near closing with Daisy, wrapped in blue. The cut at the hock looked bad to them, but to me it was a fixable thing: clean margins, good perfusion, tendon sheathed and whole. I like to lay out the plan in simple lines. Rinse warm. Block pain. Stitch in small, even steps. I talk while I work—what I’m doing, what comes next, what they might see tonight and tomorrow. Daisy watches my hands. When the line of knots is done, she gives two slow tail taps. That sound always lands in my chest. I wrap, collar, and write the care notes in large, plain script. The couple stand a little straighter. They thank me, but what they really thank is the method. Method is a kind of kindness. It catches worry and sets it down gently. I locked the clinic later and stood in the quiet, the smell of saline still in the air, feeling the day settle."

            "story": "Evening. A soft knock, then the blue blanket comes through the door with Daisy in careful arms. The couple is worried the way people get when something looks worse than it is. Daisy’s hock is open but orderly: edges clean, tendon tucked away and safe, good blood where it should be. I say the steps out loud because steps give shape to fear: clean, numb, stitch, wrap, rest. We do just that, in order. Warm saline first, until the rinse runs clear. A small line of lidocaine, then a minute to let the skin go quiet. I place simple interrupted stitches—small bridges that let the edges meet without pulling. Daisy thumps her tail twice when the last knot lands. I fit the collar, wrap the joint, and hand them the plan written big and plain: when to give the pill, how to keep the bandage dry, what not to fear, when to call me. Their faces soften as we talk through it. I walk them out. The room goes quiet again. I wipe the table in slow circles and feel the day settle. Nothing dramatic happened, and that is the point. This work turns panic into a list, and a list into a night of sleep."

            "story": "Close to closing. A soft knock, then the door opens a careful inch. Daisy is wrapped in blue, gold fur at the edge. The hock is open but tidy. I tell them the steps in plain words: we’ll wash until it’s clear, we’ll make it numb, we’ll place small stitches that let the edges meet without strain. I keep my voice slow. Warm saline first. The water runs with a faint pink and then turns clean. I blot, I check. I place the local line, I wait for the skin to quiet. Then I suture—simple, even, the same spacing I’ve used for years. Daisy watches my hands. When I tie the last knot, her tail gives two small thumps on the towel. I wrap the joint in a calm bandage, fit the cone, and write the plan large: pills in the morning and at night, a short walk on a short leash, keep the bandage dry, call me if the edge looks puffy or wet. Their shoulders come down as I talk. I walk them to the door and tell them the night will be ordinary again. After they leave, I sit for a minute. The room smells like saline and clean plastic. Quiet work can be enough. It was enough here."

        "story": "Late. A knock that sounds like worry learning to breathe. Blue blanket. Daisy on the table, eyes soft, trusting. The back leg is cut at the hock; it looks scary to them, but it is a fix we know. I say the steps out loud because steps make a path you can walk: wash, numb, stitch, wrap, rest. I warm the saline with my hand on the bottle. We rinse until the water runs clear and the edges show their true shape. I lay a thin line of lidocaine and wait a full minute, then I press gently and tell them what I’m seeing: good refill, tendon safe, bleeding light. I place the stitches, each one like a small bridge, not tight, not loose, just right. Daisy’s tail taps twice at the last knot. I like that sound. I wrap the joint, fit the cone, and hand them the paper with big, plain words—what to do, when to call, how the night should look. Their faces loosen as I speak. The room feels lighter. I wash my hands and listen to the quiet hum of the lights. I don’t have big speeches. I have clean steps and slow hands. That is enough. Knock, blue, warm water, two taps… two taps, home."
