      "story": "It was the first time I truly saw what a library could mean to someone. A woman named Farida came in—mid-thirties, maybe—nervous, clutching a folded-up flyer for our ESL tutoring. I remember her hands shaking slightly as she asked if it was really free. We sat at one of the corner tables and filled out the form together. She barely spoke at first, just nodded and smiled. Over the next months, I watched her bloom—asking questions, laughing, staying after class to help others. One afternoon, she brought in a homemade card that said, 'Thank you for making space for me.' I still keep it tucked in my desk. That moment reminded me libraries aren’t just about information—they’re about belonging. That’s when I stopped seeing our programs as 'extras' and started fighting for them as essentials."

      "story": "There was this woman, Farida—I think of her often. She walked into the library holding one of our ESL flyers like it might vanish. That was maybe twelve years ago? She looked so unsure, like she didn’t quite believe we’d help her, and for free. We sat down, filled out the form, and she barely made eye contact. But over time, she became one of our most consistent learners—always early, always kind. One day she handed me a little card, handmade, that said, 'Thank you for making space for me.' I still have it. That phrase has stuck with me. 'Making space.' That’s the core of what libraries should do, isn’t it? Not just store knowledge, but create room—for voices, for growth, for belonging. She reminded me of that without even meaning to."

      "story": "Farida—yes, I remember her well. She walked in holding a creased ESL flyer, asking in a near-whisper if the tutoring was really free. We sat together at a side table and went through the form. She was quiet at first, clearly nervous, but she came back week after week. Over time, her confidence grew—she started asking questions, even staying to help newer students. One day, she brought me a small, handmade card that said, 'Thank you for making space for me.' I still keep it in the top drawer of my desk. That simple phrase reminded me what the library is truly about: not just access to information, but a place where people feel safe, welcomed, and seen. That’s always been the real work."

      "story": "Some memories take on a kind of quiet shine with age, and Farida’s story is one of them. She came to us years ago—nervous, polite, clutching one of our ESL flyers like it was a lottery ticket. I helped her fill out the forms. She barely spoke at first, but she kept coming. Little by little, she found her voice. And one day, she brought me a card—small, handmade, and lovely. It read, 'Thank you for making space for me.' I’ve kept that card ever since. It captures what I always hoped the library could be: a place of gentle welcome. Of dignity. Of belonging. That memory has outlasted many others, and it still makes me feel deeply grateful for the work I got to do."

      "story": "Farida. I still remember her name. She came to the library holding a flyer—ESL tutoring, back when we first expanded those programs. She was so quiet, so unsure, but she returned week after week. I remember watching her open up, slowly, steadily, like a flower unfolding in soft light. One day, she gave me a small card, hand-cut and decorated with marker flowers. It said: 'Thank you for making space for me.' I’ve kept that card all these years. It lives in the drawer by my reading chair. When people ask me what libraries really do, I think of that card. And I tell them: we make space—for learning, for confidence, for connection. That’s what I’m proudest of. That’s what I’ll always hold onto."
