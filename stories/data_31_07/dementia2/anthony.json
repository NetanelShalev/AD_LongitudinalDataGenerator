      "story": "It was a Thursday night, pouring rain, and I’d just pulled up outside that old jazz bar on West 52nd. Guy comes out in a wrinkled suit, soaked to the bone, clutching a trumpet case like it was gold. I popped the trunk and he slid in without a word. Told me to take him to Queensbridge—long ride. I kept the radio off, figured he needed quiet. Somewhere near Roosevelt Avenue, he started humming, low and sweet. Then he said, ‘You think music forgives you?’ I told him, ‘It forgives faster than people.’ He didn’t respond, just smiled and looked out the window. When we pulled up, he left a ten and a folded sheet of music on the seat. No note. Just the title: “Rain at 2 A.M.” I kept it. Never played a note, but I knew it meant something. Still do."

      "story": "Few years back, rainy Thursday night—I remember because it was the kind of rain that makes the whole city shine like glass. I picked up a guy outside a jazz club, trumpet case under his arm, looked like he’d been through it. Told me to head out to Queensbridge. We didn’t talk at first, just sat in the hush. Somewhere past Jackson Heights, he asked if music could forgive a man. I said, ‘Music forgives faster than people do.’ He kind of chuckled, like he knew that already. When he left, he didn’t say goodbye—just left a sheet of music on the backseat. Said “Rain at 2 A.M.” on it. I held onto it. That ride’s always stuck with me."

      "story": "It was raining... late night, sometime years back. Picked up a fella outside a jazz place. He had a case—trumpet, I think. Said Queensbridge. He was quiet, real quiet. Humming to himself, maybe. I think he asked me something... about forgiveness? Music? I told him... something like music forgives. Yeah. He looked out the window, didn’t say much else. When we got there, he left behind... a paper? Sheet music? I remember the name: 'Rain at 2 A.M.' I don’t know what it meant, but it felt heavy, like it mattered. I put it in the glove box for a while. It reminded me of... something. Peaceful."

      "story": "There was this ride... night, it rained. One of those nights where the lights look like watercolors. I picked up... someone with a trumpet, I think. He said to drive to... Queens? Or was it Brooklyn? We didn’t talk much. I remember him asking about... forgiveness, I think? Something about music. I said something back—I forget the words. He smiled, though. At the end, he left a... a page? With notes on it. The title was 'Rain at 2... something.' That’s what I remember. That feeling—like something important passed between us. Even if I can’t hold all the pieces anymore."

      "story": "It was raining, I know that. And there was a man, soft-spoken, holding... something. An instrument. A horn? He got in the cab. We went... somewhere far. There was music, maybe just in our heads. He said something... about forgiving? And I answered, I think. It felt like the kind of night you don’t forget. When he got out, he left me... a paper. With words? Music notes? The name had ‘rain’ in it. That stuck with me. I don’t recall all of it now, but I know it was real. Some rides just... stay."

      "story": "There was a ride, long ago. Rain fell heavy—like the whole sky was weeping. Someone came in, holding... a case? Could’ve been an instrument. We didn’t talk much, but... something passed between us. Words? Music? I’m not sure anymore. He left behind... something. A note, or music sheet. I kept it. 'Rain'—that word was on it. It meant something once. Still feels like it does, even if I don’t know why. I remember the quiet in the car. How the city softened. And how, for a moment, everything felt... gentle."
