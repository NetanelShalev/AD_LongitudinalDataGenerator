I explained my process, he challenged my assumptions, and together we found the culprit—a single misplaced pointer. We celebrated with cold pizza and laughter. That night, I realized he’d become a real engineer, and I felt a quiet pride I still carry."

He spotted something I missed—a pointer, I think. We fixed it, laughed, and ate cold pizza. That’s when I knew he was really growing into the craft."
