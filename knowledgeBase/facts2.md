# Communication in the progression of disease

## Overview
In most patients with AD, cognitive symptoms, such as memory loss and language deficits, appear early and continue to worsen over time. These are followed by functional and behavioral symptoms (Lovestone and Gauthier, 2001).

## Language and non-verbal communication in AD
Language disturbances experienced by patients with AD include word recall and word-finding difficulties, and revisions and repetition during speech (Bayles et al., 1992; Weiner et al., 2008; de Lira et al., 2011). In addition to loss of verbal fluency, reading and writing skills deteriorate, and comprehension and concentration (and, of course, memory) are also affected, which leads to problems with maintaining and following conversation (Bayles et al., 1992; Powell et al., 1995; Orange and Ryan, 2000). Persons with AD also demonstrate decline in non-verbal communication (Glosser et al., 1998). Behavior and gestures such as head and hand movements, facial expression, and body posture form a significant part of everyday communication, and impairments in gestural clarity have been shown to correlate with linguistic decline in patients with AD (Glosser et al., 1998). Together with the selection of words and phrasing, non-verbal signs help to indicate a person's attitude and emotions, and play an important role in personal interactions (Schiaratura, 2008).

## Correlation with disease severity and early indicators
As AD progresses, the gradual emergence of language and communication issues is usually associated with global cognitive deficits (Blair et al., 2007; Weiner et al., 2008). Language problems have been detected in the earliest stages of AD, and appear to correlate with disease severity (Forbes-McKay and Venneri, 2005; Blair et al., 2007). These observations have led to language decline being suggested as both an early sign to be used in the differential diagnosis of AD (from mild cognitive impairment) and as a means of measuring disease progression (Forbes-McKay and Venneri, 2005). A high level of verbal impairment in early-stage AD has even been shown to predict mortality (Cosentino et al., 2006).

## Symptom trajectory by disease stage
In early AD, communication issues center on problems with word finding/naming and subtle conversational skills, including descriptive ability (Bayles et al., 1992; Frank, 1994). At this stage, reading, writing, and comprehension remain relatively undisturbed in comparison with healthy elderly individuals (Bayles et al., 1992). As the disease progresses, communication skills decline and extend to include difficulties with functional language use, concept formation, comprehension, and writing, with reliance on syntactic ability (Fromm and Holland, 1989; Bayles et al., 1992; Frank, 1994). The capacity for oral reading appears to remain intact for the longest period, declining only in mid/late dementia (Bayles et al., 1992). In advanced disease, communication problems become even more significant, and are compounded by severe memory and intellectual deficits (Frank, 1994). In these later stages, articulation may also be affected, and patients eventually exhibit almost no sensible verbal output â€“ they may be silent, exhibit speech patterns such as echolalia, or utter words/phrases without meaning (Fromm and Holland, 1989; Bayles et al., 1992; Weiner et al., 2008). In some cases, certain aspects of non-verbal signaling, such as bodily gestures, may be retained in advanced AD, making it possible for patients to retain an element of very basic communication for as long as their signals can be meaningfully interpreted (Schiaratura, 2008).

## Impact on patients, carers, and families
As may be expected, these wide-ranging and increasingly severe communication deficits have a profound impact on the lives of patients with AD, as well as their carers and families. Difficulties with language can produce frustration, as the patients are unable to express themselves adequately, and dysfunction both in expression and reception of language can result in distressing misinterpretation (Potkins et al., 2003). Problems with word finding, repeating questions, and following and maintaining conversation are also common (Powell et al., 1995), and affect both domestic and social contact. Consequently, the failure to communicate has a progressive negative impact on the maintenance of close relationships, social and personal interactions, and autonomy in daily life (Orange and Ryan, 2000; Potkins et al., 2003; Schiaratura, 2008; Williams, 2011). The patient may feel isolated, and suffer from the lack of close support. Indeed, language impairment in AD has been associated with the development of significant behavioral problems and psychological symptoms (Potkins et al., 2003). A UK-based study of 315 elderly patients with dementia in care facilities found that difficulties in language expression and reception were correlated with delusions, aberrant motor behavior, and, to some extent, depression, even when controlling for severity of disease (Potkins et al., 2003). Language deficits were also associated with decreased participation in social activities and social withdrawal in this population (Potkins et al., 2003). A breakdown in communication can also be a psychological burden to caregivers, as well as a distressing personal and practical issue (Hendryx-Bedalov, 2000; Savundranayagam et al., 2005). A study of family caregivers in dementia found that communication issues predicted behavioral problems in patients with AD, which was a causative factor for all forms of caregiver burden (demand, stress, and objective; Savundranayagam et al., 2005).

## Physician's perspective and clinical communication
From a physician's perspective, maintenance of communication channels with a patient with AD is of great value in terms of understanding disease progression and supplying appropriate caregiving and medical treatment (Hendryx-Bedalov, 2000). Tailoring medical communication needs to an individual patient is also acknowledged as important for maintaining a patient's self-identity and promoting respect between patient and physician (Orange and Ryan, 2000).
