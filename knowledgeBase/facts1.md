# Alzheimer’s Disease: Early Speech-Related Signs

> More people than ever are being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease.  

## Prevalence

**Ten million** people are diagnosed with dementia worldwide each year – that’s more than ever. According to the Alzheimer’s Society, approximately **one million** people in the UK are currently living with the disease. Studies predict this figure will rise to **1.6 million** by **2050**.

## What is Alzheimer’s disease?

Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia and leads to a decline in memory and thinking skills. This is a physical illness that causes the brain to stop working properly and gets worse over time. Identifying the onset of Alzheimer’s early can help patients and caregivers find the right support and medical care.

## Why language changes matter

One way to detect Alzheimer’s early is by spotting changes to people’s use of language. This is because new speech problems are one of the first signs of a mental decline that could indicate the onset of this disease.

## Five early, speech-related signs to look out for

### 1) Pauses, hesitations, and vagueness
One of the most recognisable symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease is trouble remembering specific words, which can often lead to frequent or long pauses and hesitations. When a person with Alzheimer’s is struggling to remember a word, they may talk vaguely (for example, saying **“thing”**), or describe and talk around a word.  
For example, if someone is having trouble remembering the word “dog”, they may say something like: “People have them as pets … they bark … I used to have one when I was a child.”

### 2) Using words with the wrong meaning
Trouble remembering the right word can be an early feature of Alzheimer’s. People might replace a word they are trying to say with something related to it. For example, instead of saying “dog”, they might say **“cat”**. In the early stages, these changes are more likely to be broader or more general categories, such as saying **“animal”** instead of “cat”.

### 3) Talking about a task rather than doing it
Someone with Alzheimer’s may struggle with completing tasks. Instead of performing a task, they may talk about their feelings toward the task, express doubts, or mention past abilities. They might say, **“I’m not sure I can do this”** or **“I used to be good at this”**, rather than discussing the task directly.

### 4) Less word variety
A more subtle indicator is the tendency to use simpler language, relying on common words. People with Alzheimer’s often repeat the same verbs, nouns, and adjectives instead of using a broader vocabulary. They can also use **“the”**, **“and”**, or **“but”** frequently to connect sentences.

### 5) Difficulty finding the right words
People can have trouble thinking of words, objects, or things that belong in a group. This is sometimes used as a cognitive test. For example, those with Alzheimer’s may struggle to name things in a specific category, such as different foods, parts of the body, or words that start with the same letter. This gets harder as the disease progresses, making these tasks increasingly challenging.

## Who is at risk?

Age is the biggest risk factor for developing Alzheimer’s – the chance of developing the disease **doubles every five years after the age of 65**. However, **one in 20** people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease are under the age of 65. This is referred to as **younger/early-onset Alzheimer’s disease**.

## When to seek help

While forgetting words now and then is normal, persistent and worsening problems remembering words, speaking fluently, or using a variety of words could be an early sign of Alzheimer’s disease. Identifying these signs early can be particularly important for people at higher risk as they age, such as people with **Down Syndrome**.
