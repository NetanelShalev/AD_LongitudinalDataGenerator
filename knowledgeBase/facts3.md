# Speech-to-Text Features (Verbatim Annotation Guide)

Goal: Preserve as many spoken characteristics as possible in text.

- Verbatim default: keep filled pauses, repetitions, stutters, repairs, disfluencies.

Pauses
- Short pause: "..."
- Trail-off: "..." at end of phrase
- Abrupt cutoff: "—" (em dash)

Fillers and backchannels (write as heard)
- "uh", "um", "ahh", "er", "eh", "mm", "hmm"
- Affirming: "mm-hmm", "uh-huh"
- Negating: "uh-uh"
- Lengthen for drawn-out sounds: "ahhh", "ummm" (cap at 3-4 repeated letters)

Stutters, repetitions, and cutoffs
- Sound/letter stutter: "I w- want to..."
- Word repetition: "I I think..."
- Partial word cutoff: "go- going"
- Self-repair: "I went — I mean, I thought we should go."

Elongation
- Repeated letters: "sooo", "riiiight"
- Optional colon form: "so:" (use one colon per elongated vowel)

Overlapping and interruptions
- Overlap span (inline): "[overlap]" at interruption point and resume normally
- Alternative for turn-taking: Use em dash "—" where one speaker is cut off
- Keep both speakers' words verbatim in order they occur

Non-speech sounds (bracketed)
- "[laughter]" or inline "ha ha" if lexical; prefer "[laughter]" for non-lexical
- "[sigh]", "[breath]", "[cough]", "[clears throat]", "[sniff]", "[mouth click]"
- Background: "[music]", "[applause]", "[noise]", "[door closes]"

Prosody and emphasis
- Emphasis: ALL CAPS for single words, or *italics* for phrases (optional)
- Rising intonation (question-like): use "?" when appropriate
- Strong emphasis/exclamation: "!"

Numbers, dates, acronyms
- Transcribe as spoken: "twenty twenty-five", "F-B-I", "N-A-S-A"
- Don’t normalize unless specified

Punctuation minimalism
- Prefer simple commas and periods
- Use "..." for pauses; avoid over-punctuating disfluent speech

Examples

- Pauses and fillers:
  "I was... um... I was thinking we could, ahh, start later."

- Stutter and repair:
  "It’s the b- best — I mean, the most practical option."

- Overlap and interruption:
  "I think we should —"
  "Speaker B: Wait, but the budget..."
  "Speaker A: — right, the budget is tight."

- Non-speech sounds and elongation:
  "[sigh] Okay, sooooo we’ll try again. [laughter]"

- Backchannels:
  "Speaker A: We can deploy on Friday."
  "Speaker B: mm-hmm."
