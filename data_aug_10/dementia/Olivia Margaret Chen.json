			"story": "The case I return to is the housing discrimination trial where we represented tenants denied leases through a proxy screening algorithm. My closing argument remains a personal benchmark. I structured it not around outrage, but around incremental, documented pattern: applicant cohorts, approval differentials controlling for income and credit score, internal emails acknowledging skew while deferring remediation. I began with a tenant’s quiet line—All I wanted was a chance to pay rent on time—then widened to systemic texture: disparate impact doctrine, duty to audit tools. I held eye contact with jurors at the statistical inflection points, translating ratios into lived consequences: this percentage means families doubling up, means commutes lengthening, means children switching schools midyear. The defense tried to bury intent inside complexity; I insisted complexity is not exculpatory when governance choices are archived. When I concluded, I paused intentionally, allowing silence to settle as its own form of punctuation. We won a structured settlement with mandated third‑party audits and retroactive offers. Afterward a young intern asked how I balanced data and narrative; I told her evidence without human frame doesn’t move, and story without verifiable structure doesn’t hold. That synthesis—precision plus empathy—felt distilled that day. It still calibrates me when I prepare new arguments."    },

			"story": "I often replay the closing in the rental discrimination matter involving a flawed screening system. I organized the summation like a ladder: individual story, aggregate pattern, legal standard, remedial ask. A single tenant’s sentence—Just let me prove I can pay—served as an emotional key signature. Then I methodically walked through approval rate gaps, isolating protected class variables while holding constant financial metrics. I anticipated juror fatigue with numbers, so each ratio was paired with a concrete implication: denial equaling displacement risk, longer commutes, educational disruption. I confronted the defense’s algorithmic opacity by reframing opacity as a governance decision, not an inevitability. The silence after the final sentence felt charged, receptive. The resulting settlement enforced audit cycles and transparency obligations—structural wins beyond damages. An intern later asked about rhetoric; I said clarity is an ethical duty, not an aesthetic choice. That closing stays with me because it felt like an honest alignment of law’s tools with lived stakes."    },

			"story": "The closing argument in that screening bias trial persists as a template. I consciously braided narrative, statistical rigor, and doctrinal framing. Opening microstory, then controlled variable analysis, then statutory threshold articulation. I translated percentages into tangible life adjustments to anchor abstraction. Strategic pacing—brief silence post key exhibit slide—allowed jurors’ internal processing to catch up, reducing reactive skepticism. The defense’s appeal to complexity provided a pivot: I repositioned complexity as traceable design, thus accountable. Outcome: enforceable audits, corrective offers, data retention mandates. The memory remains vivid because it reaffirmed advocacy as disciplined translation—bridging raw evidence and moral intuition without distorting either."    },

			"story": "I think about that closing in the case with the biased rental filter. I used a tenant’s plain line, then stepped into the pattern: rate gaps after controlling for income factors. Each number carried a lived effect—longer travel, school moves. I countered their complexity shield by naming opacity a chosen setting. The pause at the end felt like the room exhaling. Settlement secured audits plus retroactive offers. It endures because it balanced data spine and human face."    },

			"story": "There was the argument—the housing case with the rental system screening people out. I opened with a tenant’s simple sentence about wanting to pay on time. I remember layering numbers after that—approval gaps—but some precise percentages take longer to surface now. I still hold the structure: story, pattern, law, remedy. I told the jury complexity is not a shield when someone chose not to look inside the tool. That phrase came clean then; I reach for parts of it now, sometimes in different order. We got audits mandated. The feeling—the charged quiet after I stopped speaking—remains sharper than some figures. Core meaning intact; some labels blur like ink in light rain."    },

			"age": 75,
			"story": "The closing—housing thing with the screen tool—stays, though pieces slip. I started with a tenant line—simple, about paying rent—then moved to numbers. I say moved now; the exact counts hide. I remember saying pattern, law, fix—those three steps. I told them the hard system wasn’t magic; people made choices. I reach for the word—opacity—I say hidden instead. We got a promise: checks, offers. I feel the pause in the room more than I see faces. Some words slide: percentage, variable. I replace them with plain ones: gaps, difference. The center holds: tell a human piece, show the repeat, ask for repair. The rest is softer, but the center holds."    }
