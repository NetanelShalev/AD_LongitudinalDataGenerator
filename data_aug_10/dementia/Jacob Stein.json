      "story": "I often return, in thought, to the afternoon a summer thunderhead rolled over campus while I was guiding a small group of honors students through a derivation that had taken me years to internalize properly: the path integral’s elegant summation giving way to a stationary phase approximation. We were in the old seminar room—the one with chalkboards on three faces—and the barometric pressure seemed to press a hush into the space. A distant rumble punctuated the sequence of equations like low percussion. One of the students, Miriam, hesitated before a step, sensing an intuitive gap between formal manipulation and physical meaning. I remember drawing a tiny diagram—a particle traversing not a single trajectory but a blurred fan of conceivable histories—and describing how nature ‘chooses’ not by deterministic prescription but by the reinforcement of phases, destructive interference thinning the improbable. Their faces shifted from polite attention to genuine recognition, that subtle widening of the eyes when abstraction locks onto something sensorial. After the storm burst, rain drummed the window air conditioner, and that rhythmic noise served as a counterpoint while we finished. What lingers is not the mathematics (though it was clean) but the fragile, luminous transfer of comprehension: the invisible handoff from one mind’s scaffolding to another’s. I left the room feeling the particular quiet joy that only genuine pedagogical resonance affords—a resonance more enduring than any paper’s citation arc."

      "story": "There’s a vivid memory of a storm-tinted afternoon in the old seminar room—chalk dust suspended in angled light—when I walked a handful of students through a key step in moving from the conceptual clutter of all possible paths to the dominance of those phases that align. Thunder provided a soft metronome. Miriam—bright, hesitant in the right ways—paused before accepting that what looks like an infinity of chaotic trajectories can yield a sharply defined classical path through cancellation. I sketched overlapping curves, suggested they imagine interference not as mystery but as an exquisitely democratic vote that most paths ‘lose.’ The collective intake of breath when it clicked was almost audible. Rain started, a private percussion on the aluminum casing of the rattling window unit. I recall feeling an exact, centered contentment—a sense of intellectual stewardship briefly fulfilled. It stands, in my mind, as a proof that mentorship carries a significance equations alone do not."

      "story": "I remember a summer afternoon turning dark with an approaching storm, a small seminar—four students, chalkboards nearly filled—while we discussed why, in a path integral formulation, only a narrow band of trajectories meaningfully contributes. Thunder, distant, lent a cadence. One student, Miriam, struggled with the leap from symbolic summation to physical intuition. I drew a cluster of faint lines, then thickened the central one, describing interference as a quiet pruning process. There was a moment—brief—when her expression shifted; comprehension settling. Rain began tapping soon after. The mathematics itself has softened in my recollection’s edges, but the atmosphere—the charged quiet, the sense of handing over a carefully tended conceptual tool—remains intact. Teaching, I’ve come to believe, is a sequence of these small, resonant transfers, each one modest yet cumulative."

      "story": "There was an afternoon with a storm coming in, and a few students—four, I think—in that older room with the long chalkboards. We were going through why, out of so many possible paths, one seems to stand out—the others canceling, thinning themselves away. A young woman—Miriam—paused; she wanted to feel it, not just accept the symbols. I drew several light lines and a darker one. Explained the cancellations like a crowd’s voices falling out of phase. Thunder, then rain against the window unit. I can still feel the small silence when she nodded. Some of the formal detail has blurred for me, but that little click of understanding, that exchange, is very clear. It was a good day of teaching. A complete one."

      "story": "I think about a class—storm clouds, a few students. We were on that idea where many possible paths mostly cancel and one sort of stays. A student—her name was… Miriam, yes—looked stuck. I drew lines, one darker. Said the others kind of wash out. Rain started on the old window box. She nodded after a bit. I don’t hold the full math now, not all the symbols, but I keep the feeling of that nod. It felt like passing along something still warm. That’s what I wanted in those years."

      "story": "There was a day. Storm outside. Few students. We drew lines. Many paths, then one. The girl—Miriam—understood after I showed the darker line. Rain on the window. I don’t really keep the math now. Just her nod. Felt right. Still does."
