Mark Edward Thompson_0,Mark Edward Thompson,60,"I remember this one timber frame raising, must’ve been ten, fifteen years ago. The sky was gray, cool air. The crew was sharp, moving on my calls—‘Up slow,’ ‘Hold.’ After every pin was set, I had them recheck for plumb. I always taught the young guys that small mistakes early become big problems later. We found a crowned sill, and instead of forcing the post, we took the time to plane it down. It’s about respecting the material, not fighting it. When that bent finally settled into place, you could feel the vibration through the whole frame. A solid, satisfying thud. That’s the feeling of a job done right.

She had a nasty tear on her hock. They were so worried, their faces etched with fear. I brought them in and talked them through everything as I worked. I explained how I was cleaning the wound, making sure it was free of debris, and then how I'd place the sutures. With each step, I saw the tension leave their shoulders.

It was one of those moments where panic could have easily set in. I was with a junior engineer, sharp but new. Instead of just throwing fixes at it, we sat down and built a timeline of events, minute by minute. Her early logs were key. We traced it to an implicit cast that was messing with the index.
