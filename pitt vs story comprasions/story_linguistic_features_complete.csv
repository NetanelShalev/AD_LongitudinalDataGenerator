Mark Edward Thompson_0,Mark Edward Thompson,60,"It was timber frame raising day, early fall, with a gray sky and cool air that made the work feel sharp and focused. The crew moved on crisp calls—'Up slow,' 'Hold'—and I remember the rhythm of it, the way everyone knew their place. We were raising the main bent, and I rechecked plumb after every pin, teaching the younger guys that small deviations compound if you ignore them. At one point, the sill had a crown—just a slight bow—and instead of forcing the post to fit, I planed it down. Patient. Respectful of the material.
