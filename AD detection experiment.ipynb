    "    You know, I was just thinking about this accident I had back when I was... oh, must have been around forty. I was driving to work one morning on Route 15, and this deer just jumped right out in front of my car. Boom! Hit it head on. The whole front end was smashed up pretty bad. I remember calling my boss from the side of the road to tell him I'd be late. Had to wait for the tow truck for about an hour. The deer didn't make it, poor thing. Insurance covered most of it, but I was without a car for two weeks. My wife had to drive me to work during that time. It was a real hassle, but these things happen, you know?

Anyway, this deer came out of nowhere and... and I hit it. The car was pretty banged up. I remember being stuck there for a while waiting for... for someone to come help me. A tow truck, I think. The deer was... well, it didn't survive. I felt terrible about that. My insurance took care of most of it, but I was without a car for... oh, it felt like forever. Maybe a week? Two weeks? My wife - what's her name... Sarah, yes Sarah - she had to drive me around. She wasn't too happy about that, I can tell you. But these things happen, right?\n",

Anyway, this animal - a deer, I'm pretty sure it was a deer - it just appeared right in front of me. I couldn't stop in time and... and there was this loud crash. The front of my car was all smashed up. I remember sitting there feeling confused about what to do next. Someone came to help me eventually, but I can't recall who it was. A police officer? Or maybe... no, it was someone with a truck. They took my car away. I had to call someone to pick me up, but I'm not sure who I called. My wife maybe? Though I'm having trouble remembering... was she still driving then? Anyway, the whole thing was very upsetting. I kept thinking I should remember more details, but it all feels so foggy now.\n",

    "- The model tends to score highest on mild-to-moderate symptoms (age 66), and drops when the narrative becomes very fragmented (age 69). This likely reflects patterns in its training data, where moderately impaired speech shows clearer AD signals than severely disorganized speech.\n",
    "- Length differences can bias scores. Short, confident narratives (often at 63) and very long, fragmented ones (at 69) can both shift probabilities in unintended ways.\n",
    "- Reversal strategy: keep story lengths similar (within ~10 words) and escalate high-signal cues gradually: light hesitations at 63 → mild name/route uncertainty at 66 → stronger name/face confusion + getting lost + repeated questions at 69. This produced a monotonic increase (Attempt 5)."
