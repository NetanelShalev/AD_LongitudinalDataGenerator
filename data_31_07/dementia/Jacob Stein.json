She was just a teenager, curious and skeptical, and I used a cardboard box and her stuffed animal to make the paradox real. She laughed, asked sharp questions, and for a moment, I saw the same spark I’d seen in my best students. That afternoon, we walked home together, talking about possibility and uncertainty. It’s one of my favorite memories—teaching her, and learning from her in return."

We talked about uncertainty, and I remember feeling proud. We walked home together, still debating. That memory always makes me smile."
