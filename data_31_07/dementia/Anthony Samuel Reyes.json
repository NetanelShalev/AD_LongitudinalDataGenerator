      "story": "Let me tell you about the night I picked up that jazz musician outside the Blue Note. It was raining, the kind of rain that makes the city shine. He slid into the back seat, sax case on his lap, and asked me to take him to Harlem. We talked music, life, and he even played a riff for me right there, humming through the mouthpiece. I remember thinking, this is what I love about this job—never know who’ll step in. Dropped him off, he tipped me with a smile and a ticket to his next show. I kept that ticket for years. Nights like that, they remind you the city’s got a soul."

      "story": "That rainy night, I picked up a jazz guy outside the Blue Note. He had his sax, real cool cat. We talked about music—he even played a little tune, just for me, right in the cab. I remember the way the city lights looked in the rain, all blurred and golden. He was headed uptown, Harlem, I think. Gave me a ticket to his show as a tip. I kept it in my glove box for a long time. Funny how a stranger can make a night feel special."

      "story": "There was a night, pouring rain, I picked up a musician—jazz, I think—outside a club. He had a saxophone, or maybe it was a trumpet. We talked, he played a bit, just a few notes. I remember the city lights, the way they looked through the wet windshield. He gave me something—a ticket?—as a thank you. I kept it for a while. That ride stuck with me, though I can’t say why exactly."

      "story": "One night, it was raining, I picked up a man with an instrument. We talked, I think. He played something, or maybe he just hummed. The city was quiet, or maybe it was just late. He gave me a ticket, I think. I remember feeling good about that ride."
