      "story": "There was this night, about fifteen years ago, middle of January, cold enough to freeze your teeth. I picked up a fare on East 14th—young woman, maybe twenty-something, heels too high for snow and eyes like she’d been crying. Said she needed to go to Brighton Beach. Long ride. I didn’t ask questions, just flipped on some Sinatra—real soft, like background to her silence. Somewhere past the bridge, she asked if I believed people could start over. I said, 'Only every damn day, if you mean it.' She smiled, wiped her cheek, and we rode in quiet until Neptune Avenue. When she got out, she left me a note tucked under the seatbelt buckle. Just said: 'Thanks for not asking.' Never forgot her. City throws you moments like that sometimes—reminds you you’re not just driving a cab. You’re driving through people’s lives."

      "story": "You know, there was this snowy night—had to be maybe... fifteen, sixteen years back. Cold enough to crack the pavement. I picked up this young woman near Union Square. She was shivering and trying not to cry. Told me to take her all the way to Brighton Beach. I remember turning down the jazz—Sinatra, I think—and just letting her be. Somewhere along Ocean Parkway, she asked me if I thought people really get to start over. I told her, 'Every day’s a shot at it.' She didn’t say much after that, just stared out the window. When she got out, she left a little note—real small handwriting—tucked into the seatbelt buckle. Said something like, 'Thanks for... not asking.' I carried that note in my glove box for years. Funny what sticks with you."

      "story": "It was winter... some years back, before all this Lyft nonsense. Real cold night. I picked up a woman downtown—she was upset, I think. We didn’t talk much. She wanted to go to... Brighton Beach? Yeah, I’m pretty sure. She asked me something during the ride—about starting over, I think. And I said something back. Can’t quite remember what, but she smiled. That smile stuck. When she got out, she left something—a note? Yeah, a note. Tucked in... somewhere in the cab. I kept it for a while. It meant something, even if I don’t remember exactly what it said. It’s strange, the things that linger. Not the details—but the feeling, you know?"

      "story": "There was a ride I gave—God, I’ve told this one before, haven’t I? She was... a girl. Or a woman. It was snowing. We were downtown? Or uptown. Somewhere in the city. She needed to get... somewhere far. Brighton something. I remember her face more than the words. Sad eyes. Quiet. I think she asked me... about change? Or starting over? I think I told her something decent. She left a note, maybe. A thank-you? Could’ve been a receipt. All I know is, it mattered. That ride mattered. Even if the pieces are... harder to hold now. I remember the feeling. Like I helped, just a little. And sometimes, that’s enough."

      "story": "There was... a time. I was driving, always driving. There was snow, maybe. Cold. A girl—or a woman—was in the backseat. She didn’t talk much, I don’t think. Maybe she asked something, or I did. I can’t remember the place, but I remember the quiet. It was kind. Something was written down. A message. Or maybe I imagined that part. All I know is it felt... important. Like we shared something, even just for a moment. You forget the streets, the names—but the feeling? That stays. That part’s real. Isn’t it?"
