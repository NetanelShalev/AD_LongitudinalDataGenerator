      "story": "I remember one winter, I was working for Miss Evelyn—an older widow with a big house full of silence. Her husband had passed years before, and she didn’t have much family around. I’d clean her place twice a week. One day, I came in and found her in the parlor, struggling to open a can of soup. No heat on. I set down my mop and spent the whole morning fixing her stove, making her some lunch, and sitting with her while she talked about her late husband’s jazz records. She cried a little when I left. I didn’t charge her that day. Sometimes the job isn’t cleaning—it’s witnessing. That moment stayed with me, because it reminded me what people really need. A little warmth. A little care. That was the first time I realized housekeeping could be ministry, not just work."

      "story": "There was this winter—cold as anything—I was working at Miss Evelyn’s house. She was an older woman, alone mostly, sweet but proud. One afternoon, I showed up and found her fussing with a can of soup and no heat in the house. Poor thing was shaking. I told her, 'You sit down, I’ll handle this.' Fixed up the stove best I could, warmed up some soup, and we sat there listening to one of her old jazz records. She talked about her husband, how he used to play trumpet. I just listened. She needed someone, not just a cleaner. That’s when it hit me—this job isn’t about polish and shine. It’s about showing up. Loving strangers when they need it most. I think of her often, especially on cold days."

      "story": "There was a woman I used to clean for—Evelyn, yes. Lived alone in a big house, real quiet. This one winter day, I walked in and she was trying to open soup. Her hands weren’t strong enough, and the heat had gone out again. I remember I warmed it up on the stove—maybe the stovetop? Or the microwave? No, it was the stove. We sat and listened to—what was it? Something soft, something jazzy. Her husband’s records, I think. I didn’t finish the cleaning that day, but I stayed. We just talked. It felt important. Not sure I even charged her for it. It wasn’t about money. You just... do what's needed. That’s what I’ve always believed."

      "story": "I used to take care of this woman... older lady, real quiet house. Name was... oh, it’ll come. She had a cat, or maybe not. It was cold out, winter, and she was—she had a can, yes. Soup? I think. The heat was off, or the light. Something wasn’t working. I helped her with it. We sat, and she played... some music. Horn music. Soft. She told me about someone she loved. Her husband maybe? Or brother? I don’t recall all of it. But I stayed a while. Didn’t clean much. Just... made her warm again. That was enough. That’s what stuck with me. It felt like more than just work, you know?"

      "story": "I had a lady once... she needed help. Cold day. There was something with her stove, or her soup. She was sweet. Or sad. Maybe both. I remember the sound—music, gentle music, like a trumpet, maybe. Or piano? She said something about... someone she missed. We sat together. I didn’t clean that day. Or maybe I did? But I stayed. She smiled. Or cried. I don’t quite recall. But I know it mattered. I know I was there. I helped. That’s the part I carry with me."
