The conference room was packed, and I was nervous, but as I explained the patterns I’d found, I saw their faces change—curiosity, then understanding. Afterward, a young analyst told me she’d never thought data could tell a story. That was the moment I realized I could make a difference, not just with numbers, but with how I shared them."
