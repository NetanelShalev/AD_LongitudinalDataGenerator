      "story": "It was that summer, when the drought hit harder than we’d expected. I remember walking the north field just after dawn, the soil cracked like an old man's hands, corn leaves curling up like they were trying to hide from the sun. My daughter, Emily, was visiting, trying to learn the ropes. She looked at the ground, then at me, and asked if it was worth it. I told her, ‘Sometimes the land teaches you by breaking you a little.’ We spent the afternoon repairing the irrigation line together. I let her lead. She had grit. That day stuck with me—not because of the dry fields, but because I saw something pass between us, like a torch. Quiet. Steady. I think that was the first time I believed she could carry it forward."

      "story": "That dry summer—we were in the north field, I think. Emily was there. She’d come home to help. The soil had split open in places, bone-dry. I remember... walking with her, or maybe we were fixing something. A pipe? Yeah, irrigation. She asked if it was worth all the effort. I told her something about the land breaking you, but also teaching you. We didn’t talk much more after that, just worked in the sun. What I remember most isn’t the heat—it’s her hands in the dirt, steady, like mine used to be. I think that’s when I knew... she was ready to take the reins, in her own way."

      "story": "There was a summer—dry, very dry. Corn didn’t stand a chance. I was with Emily... we were doing something in the north field, fixing... fixing a pipe, I believe. Or maybe checking for damage? She looked worried. I said something like... the land teaches you when it breaks you. Or was it the other way around? I remember her nodding. Not talking much. Her presence—solid. She’s good with her hands. Always has been. That day... it meant something. Though I can’t quite place what exactly. I just know she was there, and we got through it."

      "story": "That summer, the one when... the corn was bad. Drought or... wind? Emily was with me. We were in the fields. Or the barn? I know she came back to help. We were fixing something. Pipes? She said something—no, I did—I think I told her about the land, how it breaks you and teaches you. I used to say that a lot. Anyway, she was calm. Like she’d been there forever. I watched her work and thought... ‘she’ll be alright.’ Even if the corn wasn’t. Even if things got harder. We were together. That’s what matters, I suppose."

      "story": "Emily and I... we were out there, in the sun. I think it was summer. Very dry. She had gloves on. Or maybe it was her boots I remember. Something about the earth—cracked, like old bark. We worked on... something metal. A fence? A pipe? Doesn’t matter much now. I said something to her, I think. About the land, about how it... teaches. She smiled, I think. That smile... warm. She stayed with me. Worked beside me. That day felt... good. Important. Even if I don’t remember all the pieces. She was there. That part, I know."
