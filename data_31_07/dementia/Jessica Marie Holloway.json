I polished the old piano, dusted the family photos, and made sure the kitchen sparkled. Mrs. Evans sat at the table, watching me, and I brewed her a cup of tea. We talked quietly, and I listened more than I spoke. That day, I learned that caring for a home is sometimes the best way to care for a heart."
