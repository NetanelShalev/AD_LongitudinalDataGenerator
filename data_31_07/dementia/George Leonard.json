      "story": "I’ll never forget the night I stayed up with Mrs. Callahan’s old retriever, Max. He was sick, and she was scared, so I brought my bag and sat with them in their living room. Max rested his head on my knee while I explained what was happening, and Mrs. Callahan told me stories about when he was a pup. By morning, Max was comfortable, and Mrs. Callahan was at peace. That’s the kind of night that reminds me why I do this work—being there, really being there, when it matters."

      "story": "There was a night, years ago, with Max, Mrs. Callahan’s retriever. He was ill, and I stayed at their house, sitting on the floor beside him. Mrs. Callahan talked about his puppy days, and I tried to comfort them both. By sunrise, Max was resting easy, and Mrs. Callahan seemed calmer. Those moments—quiet, honest—are what make this job meaningful."
