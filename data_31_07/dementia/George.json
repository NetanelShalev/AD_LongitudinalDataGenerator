            "story": "I’ll never forget the old Labrador named Daisy—she came in limping, cloudy-eyed, already twelve and full of grace. Her owner, Mr. Alston, a widower, said she’d stopped climbing the stairs. X-rays showed arthritis, nothing we couldn’t manage. I sat on the floor beside her—Daisy didn’t like tables—and told him about some joint supplements and gentle massage. A few weeks later, he brought me a thank-you card, said Daisy was sleeping upstairs again. What stayed with me, though, wasn’t the medicine—it was the way he looked at her when he said, 'She still waits by the door for my wife.' That kind of loyalty… you don’t see it much. Not just in dogs—in people too. I think about Daisy whenever I see a stiff gait or an old soul. We saved her knees, maybe. But she was saving him."

            "story": "There was this dog—Daisy, yes, a sweet old Lab. She must’ve been twelve or thirteen. Her owner, Mr. Alston, brought her in one winter—said she wasn’t climbing stairs anymore. X-rays showed arthritis. We started her on some supplements and suggested some heat therapy. Daisy didn’t care much for the exam table, so I just got down on the floor with her. Mr. Alston said she was waiting at the door every night, even after his wife passed. That line—it stuck with me. Loyalty like that, you don’t forget it. A few weeks later he brought a thank-you card. I still have it somewhere, I think. Daisy started making it up the stairs again, but what I remember most is the way that dog kept him anchored, like she knew he needed her to."

            "story": "There was this Labrador… Daisy, yes. She was older, maybe twelve. Her owner—he was… Alston? A kind man. She was having trouble… with stairs, I think. Arthritis. I remember sitting on the floor with her; she didn’t like tables. We talked about treatments—supplements, warm compresses, something gentle. He said she waited by the door. For his wife, I think. She’d passed away. That part… that part really stayed with me. It wasn’t just about fixing a limp. It was about… presence. Loyalty. I think she started climbing again after that. Or maybe she didn’t. But he was grateful. He brought in a card. Yes. A thank-you. I might still have it. It meant something."

I remember that. And I… I sat on the floor. Told him… something about… joints? Or warmth? We helped, I think. He gave me… a note. A card? I don’t know where it is now. But she was good. That dog. Kind eyes. That’s what I remember best. The eyes. And the waiting. Always the waiting."

I—what did we do? We sat. I think I sat with her. That felt right. There was a… a note? Or a look? I don’t remember all the pieces. But it mattered. It really mattered. The dog loved. She knew. You could see it. That’s… that’s the part I hold onto. Not the names, not the clinic. Just that feeling. Love, holding on. Waiting."
