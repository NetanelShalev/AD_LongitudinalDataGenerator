      "story": "It was the spring of ’89, and I’d just wrapped up a brutal semester teaching Quantum Field Theory to undergrads who were either terrified or asleep. I remember staying late in the lab, fiddling with a derivation I couldn’t quite pin down when Martin—one of my graduate students—walked in holding an early draft of his paper. He was shaking, poor guy. But the equations were solid, elegant even. We spent hours refining the argument until dawn. That was the night I realized mentorship wasn’t just about guiding—it was about witnessing someone come into their own. We ended up co-authoring the paper. It got published in a small but respected journal. Martin sent me a thank-you note five years later, after landing a faculty position. Still have it taped inside my old office door. That night stayed with me—the math, sure, but mostly the trust. The handoff. Like passing a torch."

      "story": "I think about Martin’s paper sometimes—the one he brought me late one night in ’89. I’d been at the chalkboard for hours, stuck on something irrelevant, and he came in, hands trembling with a draft. A rough one, but promising. We sat and worked through it, line by line, until sunrise. What struck me wasn’t the mathematics—it was his hunger to understand, to be understood. We polished it up and submitted it. Modest journal, but the work had integrity. Years later, he wrote to thank me. Said he’d landed a tenure-track post and that moment had made all the difference. That note meant more to me than any citation ever did. I sometimes think the most important thing I ever did in physics had nothing to do with the physics itself—it was that night, and the quiet kind of belief that passes between teacher and student."

      "story": "Martin... yes, Martin. He brought me his draft one night—must’ve been late ’80s. I was still teaching then. He looked so nervous. I’d been working on... something, something with path integrals, I think. Anyway, he hands me this paper, and it’s rough, but there’s promise. We stayed there into the early morning, talking it through. I remember he had this way of asking questions—eager but never afraid of being wrong. We got it into shape, and it was accepted—what was the journal? Hmm. No matter. He sent me a note years later, after he got a job. I kept that letter for ages. Still might have it, actually. Funny how it’s not the equations I remember most, but his expression—that moment he realized he had something worth saying. That spark. I think that’s what I miss most about the classroom."

      "story": "There was a night... one of the students, Martin—yes, that’s it—he brought me a paper. Or maybe a question? No, I think it was a paper. I remember staying late—maybe grading, or working on... something. He was nervous. I could tell. We talked, long time. Went through things, made corrections. Or suggestions. It was good work, I think. It got published, didn’t it? And then... he wrote me. Later. A letter, I believe. Said thank you. Said it mattered. That night meant something to him. And me, too. I liked those nights—the quiet ones, where you get to see someone grow in real time. Teaching was never just about the curriculum. It was about... being there. Letting someone know they were seen. That part always stayed with me."

      "story": "Martin? He brought... something to me. A paper? Or was it notes? He was young. Very young. We were... in the department office? No—my office, yes. He was worried. Or was I? No, he was. We talked. Long time. There was something he wrote, and we... worked on it. I think we worked on it. It was late. I remember that. The paper was published. I think. And later... he wrote me. A nice letter. I kept it. I’m sure I kept it. That moment... it mattered. Not because of the physics. Not really. It was something else. He believed in what he was doing. And maybe... I helped. Maybe I helped."
