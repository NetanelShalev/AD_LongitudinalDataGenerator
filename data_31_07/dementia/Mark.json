      "story": "That community center over on Monroe—that one means something. We started with nothing but an empty lot and blueprints that changed a dozen times. Tight schedule, winter delays, green apprentices. But we finished it. I remember opening day—crisp morning, light dusting of snow. Families walked in smiling, kids running through the new halls. My son James did most of the framing—damn good job. I stood by the front doors, coffee in hand, and thought, ‘We built more than walls here.’ It wasn’t fancy, but it was solid. It would hold. That building, those people—it felt like giving something back to the neighborhood. That was one of the proudest days of my life."

      "story": "The Monroe job... yeah, that was something. Long winter, lot of delays. We had some new kids on the crew—good energy, not much sense, but they listened. James was lead on framing, and I’ll tell you, he made me proud. I remember standing outside on opening day. Cold morning. There were people walking in—families mostly. I think there was a ribbon, or maybe a banner? Can’t quite picture it. But the feeling—seeing what we built used like that, it stuck with me. We did good work. Not just buildings—something that’ll last. That’s what matters in the end, isn’t it?"

      "story": "It was a job... big one. Down on... was it Monroe? I think so. We built a place for, uh, the neighborhood. Families, yeah. A lot of kids. My boy was there—James? He did... most of it, I think. I showed him how to do the beams proper. Or maybe it was the joists. It was cold that day. Snow, maybe. They opened the doors, people came in, smiling. I remember that—smiles. We made something good. Real good. I can’t recall all the details, but I know it was right. Felt proud. That kind of work, it matters."

      "story": "We built a place once—James and me. A big building. People use it, still. I think. Cold day when they opened it. Lots of faces. Happy ones. We worked hard on it, that I know. Took time. Maybe too long. There were problems—some mix-ups. But it stood tall. We fixed it. Always fix things, that’s what I taught the boys. I... I don’t remember what street it’s on, but I see it in my head, kind of. There were kids, and maybe food? I think we gave something good. I hope it’s still there."

      "story": "We made something, once. A building, yes. My son—good boy—he worked with me. We hammered and... lined it up, real straight. Cold? Might’ve been. I don’t recall. There were folks, coming in. Kids. Laughing, I think. We gave them... something warm. Walls. A roof. Safety. Feels far now, but it was a fine day. I held coffee. Or was it tea? Doesn't matter. What matters is, it meant something. Still does, even if I can’t place it quite. It stood up. We made it strong. That’s enough."
