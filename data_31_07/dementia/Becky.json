            "story": "There was a morning in Oaxaca—God, maybe fifteen years ago now—when I stumbled onto this tiny procession in a back alley. Not a tourist in sight. A boy, maybe ten, was carrying a hand-painted saint, swaying slightly with each barefoot step. The sun was just breaking through the jacaranda trees, throwing dappled light across the cobblestones. I didn’t say a word. I just crouched low and waited, shutter soft. That frame—it wasn’t about technique. It was reverence, timing, respect. The boy glanced at me, didn’t smile, didn’t pose. Just kept walking. Later, someone asked me how I ‘got access’ to such an intimate scene. I said: I didn’t. I listened. That moment didn’t belong to me. It was a gift, and I tried to treat it like one. I still have that photo printed in black and white, pinned above my desk. It reminds me to stay small."

            "story": "I was in Oaxaca—hmm, fifteen, sixteen years ago? I think it was spring. There was a quiet procession, tucked away behind some market. A young boy was carrying a small painted saint, bare feet on the stones. The light that morning—God, it was perfect. Soft but clear. I crouched and took the shot, didn’t speak a word. He didn’t flinch. That stillness—those are the moments I live for. Someone later asked how I was ‘allowed’ to shoot that. But you don’t force those things. You wait. You respect. That photo’s still in my studio, above the little shelf with the worn negatives. I look at it sometimes when I feel out of step. It reminds me what quiet looks like, and why I started this work in the first place."

It was quiet, early. The light filtered through trees just so. I crouched, didn’t say a thing, just... watched. Took a picture, one shot. That was enough. People ask me how I... how I got those photos. But I didn’t get them, not really. They were given to me. You wait, stay still, and maybe—maybe the moment lets you in. I still have it, the photo. Somewhere in my studio. Black and white. It's beautiful. I think."

I remember crouching, or kneeling... camera in my hand. I didn’t talk, just waited. It felt... quiet. That’s the word. Quiet. I took the shot. One shot? I don’t know. But it stayed with me. Still does. It’s... on the wall? No, in a book? Anyway, I remember the feeling. Like I didn’t intrude, just... witnessed. That’s the part that matters, right? Not the shutter. The pause before it."

The light was soft. I think I took a picture. I must’ve. There’s a photo—somewhere. It meant something. Peaceful. No noise. Just... a moment, still. Like breathing in before a song. That’s what I loved. That feeling. I don’t remember where it was. But I know I was there. And I saw it. I saw something beautiful, and I think... I caught it. That’s enough."
