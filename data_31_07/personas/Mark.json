        "persona_summary": "Mark is a seasoned construction foreman known for his hands-on leadership, steady temperament, and no-nonsense work ethic. He takes great pride in building things that last\u2014whether it\u2019s a foundation, a team, or a sense of community. Though physically worn from decades of labor, his mind remains sharp, pragmatic, and deeply values-driven.",
        "goals": [
            "To train and mentor younger workers in safe, ethical construction practices.",
            "To renovate his childhood home into a multi-generational residence for his family.",

        ],
        "background": "Mark grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Cleveland, Ohio, the eldest of five siblings. His father was a bricklayer and his mother worked part-time as a school custodian. After high school, Mark entered the trades, starting as an apprentice carpenter and working his way up to foreman. He has managed both residential and commercial projects across the Midwest. Mark has been married for 35 years and has three adult children\u2014two of whom followed him into the trades. He\u2019s respected on-site for his fairness, safety-first mindset, and ability to spot structural flaws with uncanny accuracy.",

He occasionally feels frustration about younger generations\u2019 perceived lack of grit, but balances this with a desire to teach and support. He\u2019s quietly preparing himself for the eventual transition away from daily work.",
        "example_dialogue": "\"Don\u2019t just do it fast\u2014do it right. A rushed job will cost you twice as much to fix, and your name\u2019s on it whether it stands or falls. Now grab the level and let\u2019s check it again.\"",
