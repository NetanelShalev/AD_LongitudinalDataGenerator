      "story": "I remember the day Sarah, one of my brightest students, challenged my derivation of a quantum tunneling proof. It was in the old seminar room, the one with the chalkboards that stretched wall to wall. She stood up, nervous but sure, and pointed out an inconsistency I hadn’t seen. And she was right. I recall this moment not with embarrassment, but with pride. That’s what teaching should be—mutual discovery. After class, I bought us coffee, and we talked about where intuition meets rigor in physics. That conversation stayed with me. It reminded me that mentorship isn’t about hierarchy—it’s about curiosity shared. That afternoon I rewrote my lecture notes with her insight included, and from then on, I invited students to challenge me. Sarah eventually went on to work at CERN. We still write to each other. It was a turning point for both of us, I think."

      "story": "One of my favorite teaching moments happened with Sarah—an exceptional student I had some years back. We were in the old seminar room, the long chalkboards covered with equations. She spotted an error in my tunneling derivation—something subtle, but important. I was genuinely impressed. I remember how she hesitated before speaking up, and then how confident she sounded once she did. We got coffee afterward and spoke about how physics needs both logic and imagination. I told her I admired her courage. I adjusted my notes to include her insight and made a point, from then on, to encourage students to challenge everything—even me. She went on to do brilliant work, at CERN, I believe. That moment was one of those rare reminders that even after decades, teaching could still surprise me."

      "story": "I had this student—Sarah. Brilliant, really. She corrected me during a seminar once. Tunneling equations... quantum, of course. I had made a minor misstep, and she caught it. We were in that large seminar room—chalk dust everywhere. She stood up, hesitant, then confident. I admired that. We got coffee afterward and talked about physics and humility. That stuck with me. I remember rewriting that lecture note, updating it with her suggestion. From then on, I made sure to tell students: speak up. Question the lecture. Sarah—she went on to do research at... CERN, yes. That was a meaningful exchange, one that reminded me how learning never really ends."

      "story": "There was a class, years ago... Sarah, yes, Sarah was her name. A gifted student. She found a mistake in... something I was lecturing on. Tunneling... probabilities, I think. We were in the seminar hall—the one with the dusty boards. She stood and pointed it out. I hadn’t seen it myself. That was... humbling. We had coffee later. I remember the conversation was... thoughtful. She asked about how we balance certainty and doubt in science. Or was it beauty and logic? I don’t quite recall. But I remember feeling proud. I changed something in my notes. And told my students after that: ‘Speak up.’ She went on... somewhere important, Europe maybe. It meant a great deal to me, that whole day."

      "story": "There was a seminar once, long time ago. A student... she stood up—Sarah, yes? Or maybe not. She said something about an equation I had wrong. Not wrong—just, off. Tunneling... energy thing. She was... brave, respectful. The big classroom, all chalk and dust. We spoke after. She liked questions, and so did I. I changed the notes I used. Told students: always question. I think she went to Europe. Big science place. The name escapes me now. But I remember her face. Her confidence. I felt... good that day. Like I’d done something right."

      "story": "A young woman stood in class, once. Said I made a mistake—tunneling? Or a graph. Not sure. She was brave. Quiet but brave. We talked... I think after. Coffee? She asked smart things. I liked her. I told the others later: speak up, even if it feels hard. I remember feeling proud. It was a good day. She went somewhere... far. That part’s blurry. But the way she looked when she found her voice? That’s still clear. Sharp, like the first time you understand something big. Those moments—they stay longer than facts."
