      "story": "It was a Sunday morning—one of those golden New Mexico mornings where even the shadows are soft. A woman brought in an old golden retriever named Max. Max could barely walk, his hips were gone, his breathing shallow. She’d had him since college. We sat together on the floor of the exam room, her hand on his chest, mine gently over his paw. I gave him the injection slowly. She whispered to him, not sobbing, just... grateful. When it was done, she stayed a while. I remember telling her, ‘He didn’t suffer. He felt you there the whole time.’ She nodded. That moment—it reminded me why I do this. Not just to heal, but to witness. To make endings as gentle as beginnings. I went home that night and played Bach on the guitar. The notes felt like prayers."

      "story": "It was a calm morning, one of those clear, early spring days. A woman came in with her retriever—Max, I think. Big old boy. He was struggling to stand. She said she’d had him since college. We sat down on the floor together in the exam room. I remember her holding him, brushing behind his ears while I gave the injection. She didn’t cry, not loudly—just stayed there with him. Quiet. When it was over, she kissed his head and thanked me. I told her he felt safe right to the end. That’s something I try to give. Not just comfort to the animal, but to the human too. That day... it stayed with me. I think I went home and played some guitar after. Something slow. Soft."

      "story": "This was a few years ago now... I think. It was a quiet morning. A woman came in with her dog... Max? Yes, Max. Big retriever, very old. Could barely stand. She’d had him a long time—since school, I think. We ended up sitting together on the floor. I remember that clearly. I gave the injection gently. She held him, whispered something. I told her he was at peace. She thanked me... or maybe she didn’t say much. But the look on her face—calm, grateful—it meant a lot. I remember feeling... I don’t know, still, afterward. I think I played something on the guitar later that night. Maybe Bach."

      "story": "There was a woman... she brought in a dog. Big one. Max? Maybe. It was early in the day. I remember sunlight, maybe coming through the blinds. The dog was old, real tired. We sat together—me and her—on the floor. She held him while I... did what had to be done. I said something afterward. That he was safe. She seemed... calm. Or thankful. I think she was thankful. I remember that. Not the words, but the feeling. I came home and played—something quiet. I do that sometimes after those days."

      "story": "There was a dog, a big soft one. Name’s slipping my mind. Max? Could be. A woman brought him in, said she’d had him a long time. We sat down on the floor, all three of us. He was tired, barely lifted his head. She held onto him. I think I said something when it was over, something kind. She looked... at peace. Not happy, no, but okay. I don’t remember the rest so well. Just the quiet. And the way she didn’t rush to leave. That sticks with me. Like music without notes—just... stillness."

      "story": "I remember a dog. Big and gentle. Name... I forget. A woman brought him in. She sat with him on the floor. I was there too. It was time to say goodbye, I think. She stroked his fur. I did what I needed to. The room was quiet. I remember quiet. Peaceful, maybe. Or still. She looked at me, or maybe she said something. It felt... good. Not happy, but... right. I think I went home and... played something on the guitar. That part feels true, even if I’m not sure when."
