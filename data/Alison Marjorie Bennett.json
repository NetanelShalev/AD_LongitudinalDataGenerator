            "story": "It was the first time I truly saw what a library could mean to someone. A woman named Farida came in—mid-thirties, maybe—nervous, clutching a folded-up flyer for our ESL tutoring. I remember her hands shaking slightly as she asked if it was really free. We sat at one of the corner tables and filled out the form together. She barely spoke at first, just nodded and smiled. Over the next months, I watched her bloom—asking questions, laughing, staying after class to help others. One afternoon, she brought in a homemade card that said, 'Thank you for making space for me.' I still keep it tucked in my desk. That moment reminded me libraries aren’t just about information—they’re about belonging. That’s when I stopped seeing our programs as 'extras' and started fighting for them as essentials."

            "story": "There was this woman, Farida—I think of her often. She walked into the library holding one of our ESL flyers like it might vanish. That was maybe twelve years ago? She looked so unsure, like she didn’t quite believe we’d help her, and for free. We sat down, filled out the form, and she barely made eye contact. But over time, she became one of our most consistent learners—always early, always kind. One day she handed me a little card, handmade, that said, 'Thank you for making space for me.' I still have it. That phrase has stuck with me. 'Making space.' That’s the core of what libraries should do, isn’t it? Not just store knowledge, but create room—for voices, for growth, for belonging. She reminded me of that without even meaning to."

            "story": "I remember—yes, there was a woman... her name was Farida, I think. She came into the library—nervous, holding something in her hand, maybe a paper. One of our programs, the English classes. She didn’t say much at first. Just sat and listened. But she came back, again and again. She was... kind. Bright. One day she gave me a little card—handmade. It said something about space. 'Thank you for making space for me.' That’s what it said. I still keep it somewhere—maybe in my top drawer. She changed how I thought about this work. It wasn’t just books, or databases. It was people, needing to be seen. I wish I remembered her face better now. But I remember how I felt when she smiled."

            "story": "There was a lady—sweet, yes. She came to the library, very quiet. I think she needed help... with words? English words. She had a paper. We sat together. Or maybe she sat with someone else—I’m not sure now. But I remember... I remember she brought a card. Small, handmade. It said something... something about space. About making it. She was thankful. She came back a lot, I think. Kind smile. I kept that card. I think I still have it, or maybe I gave it to someone. She reminded me that the library was more than shelves. It was... soft places. Places where you don’t have to ask to belong. That’s what I always wanted it to be."

She smiled a lot, after a while. At first, she was... small, quiet. But then—brighter. We made space. She said that. The card said that. 'Thank you for the space.' I think it meant... I helped. That’s what I wanted. That’s what I did. Books, yes—but more than books. I remember that. The card. Her smile. I remember that."
