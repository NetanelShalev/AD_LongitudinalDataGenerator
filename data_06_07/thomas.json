      "story": "It was the day Mia graduated high school. I swapped shifts with Bobby to make it in time, drove the early route, and rushed home to change into the only suit I still owned. I remember standing in the back of the auditorium, just behind a row of folding chairs, heart thumping like it was my own name being called. When she walked across the stage—chin up, that confident walk of hers—I swear I forgot to breathe. She found me afterward in the crowd, and we hugged for a long time. She said, 'We did it, Dad.' Not 'I did it'—'we.' That got me more than anything. We went for ice cream after, like when she was little. She still orders mint chocolate chip, always has. That day meant everything to me—not because she graduated, but because she saw me in it. In her journey. As part of it."

      "story": "Mia’s graduation... yeah, that day still stands out. I’d worked the morning shift—dead tired, but adrenaline carried me through. I remember thinking I’d embarrass her with my old suit, sleeves too short and all, but she just smiled when she saw me. Her name echoed over the PA system, and she walked across that stage like she owned it. She caught my eye from the crowd—gave a little wave—and I nearly lost it. Later, she hugged me and said, 'We did it.' I’ve thought about that line a hundred times since. We went for mint chip ice cream afterward, her favorite. That whole day felt like a movie, not flashy, just... full. Full of meaning. I guess, in that moment, I finally felt like I’d done right by her. Like all the early mornings and scraped-together dinners had led to something real."

      "story": "Ah... Mia’s graduation—high school, not college. That was a good day. Hot, I think, or maybe just sunny. I remember rushing from my shift—early one, I think Bobby covered my afternoon route. Didn’t want to miss her walking the stage. She wore this green robe, or maybe it was blue... no, green, I’m pretty sure. She had this grin that said she knew exactly what she was doing. I stood in the back, just behind some folding chairs, and when she found me later in the crowd, she said, 'We did it, Dad.' Funny, how those words stuck. We had ice cream—mint chip for her, like always. I had coffee flavor, or maybe butter pecan? Doesn’t matter. What matters is she looked at me like I was part of the win. Like I hadn’t just driven her to school—I helped her believe in herself. That’s something."

      "story": "Mia’s... it was her school thing. She was on stage, wearing one of those caps—flat tops, you know. Tassels. I was there. I remember the gym... or auditorium? Bright lights, plastic chairs. I think I came late or maybe left early. But I saw her. She smiled. She waved? Yes, waved. And after, she hugged me. Said, um, something like... 'We made it'? Or 'We did it'? She was proud. I was proud too, just tired. Ice cream later. She had minty something. It’s her favorite—always has been. That day... it was important. I don’t remember all the pieces now, but I remember how I felt. Like she was becoming something, and I got to see it."

She... hugged me, later. Said something... good. We... got ice cream. I think. Mint. That’s her kind. I don’t recall it all. But she looked at me, and... I knew she loved me. That part’s still there. That part stays."
